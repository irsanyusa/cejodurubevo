We&nbsp;undoubtedly love them, but sometimes their equally <a href=# title=talented data-link=tag>talented</a> colleagues remain in&nbsp;the shadows of&nbsp;the top stars. Let’s remember the actors and actresses who act brilliantly in&nbsp;<a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a> but somehow do&nbsp;not receive much attention.</p><p>And at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article, we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;be&nbsp;frank and tell you which screen stars our authors adore. Some of&nbsp;them have been unfairly overlooked despite their dazzling talent, while others are in&nbsp;high demand but are viewed with skepticism for some reason.</p><p><h2>Lena Headey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b7/91b/720e795832837423523d63c275.jpg><p>Internet users are <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>puzzled</a> as&nbsp;to&nbsp;why Lena Headey has not received any prestigious film awards yet, as&nbsp;the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>amazes</a> viewers with her stunning performance in&nbsp;many movies, including <i>The Purge</i>, <i>300</i>, and <i>Dredd</i>, among others. And in&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series <a href=#><i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i></a>, she arguably out-acted all of&nbsp;her colleagues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9de/a10/ff589a512185eb0ecb05254b7b.jpg><p>For example, some viewers compare the performance of&nbsp;Emilia Clarke, who played Daenerys in&nbsp;<i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i>, quite coldly. They <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>say</a> that the actress only showed 3&nbsp;emotions throughout the entire series.</p><p>In&nbsp;their opinion, Lena Headey <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>deserves</a>, perhaps, even more fame than Clarke. Viewers believe that her performance was truly brilliant and very <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressive</a>. And for the amount of&nbsp;hatred Headey was able to&nbsp;evoke toward her character, viewers honored her by&nbsp;calling her a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>great</a> actress.</p><p><h2>Yvonne Strahovski</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/354/9ea/ce102c5c73ac248bf6e1467275.jpg><p>Viewers <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believe</a> that she acts in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;way that you really believe her. Moreover, in&nbsp;their opinion, Yvonne is&nbsp;capable of&nbsp;portraying a&nbsp;wide range of&nbsp;characters. For example, netizens confess that after watching <i>The Handmaid’s Tale</i>, they truly hated her character (in&nbsp;the photo). And in&nbsp;another series, <i>Stateless</i>, her character brought about a&nbsp;literal waterfall of&nbsp;tears.</p><p><h2>Doug Jones</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9dd/6b5/f4f1c6584393929b2e21ad49a0.jpg><p>Actually, Doug Jones has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>appeared</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge number of&nbsp;movies, many of&nbsp;which are widely known, including <i>Hocus Pocus</i>, <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, <i>Men in&nbsp;Black II</i>&nbsp;(pictured on&nbsp;the left), and <i>The Shape of&nbsp;Water</i> (pictured on&nbsp;the right), to&nbsp;name a&nbsp;few. However, his face is&nbsp;not visible behind thick layers of&nbsp;<a href=# title=makeup data-link=tag>makeup</a>.</p><p>Viewers <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believe</a> that the makeup doesn’t hinder Jones from delivering an&nbsp;excellent performance and creating unique characters. However, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;often called one of&nbsp;the most underrated <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> actors because directors don’t give him the opportunity to&nbsp;showcase his talent without makeup.</p><p><h2>Barbara Hershey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/193/b13/5cf0145c088d6395a4383e67a6.jpg><p>Hershey started acting in&nbsp;movies back in&nbsp;the 1960s and audiences warmly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remember</a> the actress’s roles. However, fans of&nbsp;Hershey’s work are bitter about the fact that the organizers of&nbsp;major film awards and even many viewers rarely pay attention to&nbsp;her work.</p><p>Barbara’s fans particularly note her roles in&nbsp;the movies <i>The Entity</i>, <i>Tune in&nbsp;Tomorrow</i>, <i>The Public Eye</i>, <i>Falling Down</i>, and <i>Black Swan</i>.</p><p><h2>Joel Edgerton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3f3/789/6494515fe3ab54ea30686ada67.jpg><p>Perhaps Edgerton’s most famous character is&nbsp;when he&nbsp;played Daisy’s husband in&nbsp;<i>The Great Gatsby</i>. Audiences <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>note</a> that the actor convincingly played the villain in&nbsp;this film. Some even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rank</a> him on&nbsp;par with Leonardo DiCaprio, the film’s main star. And some even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>claim</a> that in&nbsp;scenes involving Edgerton, all the attention is&nbsp;focused solely on&nbsp;him because of&nbsp;how he&nbsp;performs.</p><p>Audiences also admire the actor’s other roles, like in&nbsp;the films <i>Exodus: Gods and Kings</i>, <i>Bright</i>, and the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise, among others.</p><p><h2>Kate Walsh</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc5/85c/7df53153bc88b5cddf144626a6.jpg><p>Kate Walsh is&nbsp;mainly known for her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>roles</a> in&nbsp;TV series. However, audiences would like to&nbsp;see her more often in&nbsp;feature films. In&nbsp;their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>opinion</a>, she always plays brilliantly, whether it’s her heart-wrenching role in&nbsp;the series <i>13&nbsp;Reasons Why</i> (pictured on&nbsp;the left) or&nbsp;her truly devilish character in&nbsp;<i>The Umbrella Academy</i> (pictured on&nbsp;the right).</p><p><h2>Jason Isaacs</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9a4/629/7181d65525892b62c6dc37751a.jpg><p>Some viewers are <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dissatisfied</a> that Jason Isaacs mainly plays supporting roles like Draco’s father in&nbsp;the series of&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Harry Potter</i></a> films (pictured on&nbsp;the left) or&nbsp;appears in&nbsp;low-grade projects. According to&nbsp;internet users, all one needs to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the actor’s work in&nbsp;the series <i>Awake</i> (pictured on&nbsp;the right), and it&nbsp;will immediately become clear: this actor is&nbsp;phenomenal, but he&nbsp;is&nbsp;given insignificant roles.</p><p><h2>Jeremy Renner</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eb1/225/ecb3955c6db9d6dc37247742e3.jpg><p>Jeremy Renner is&nbsp;primarily known to&nbsp;the general public for his role as&nbsp;Clint Barton in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Marvel data-link=tag>Marvel</a> film series. However, his fans are <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>outraged</a> by&nbsp;this state of&nbsp;affairs. In&nbsp;their opinion, the actor’s abilities are much more expansive, and filmmakers should have given him the opportunity to&nbsp;go&nbsp;beyond superhero blockbusters a&nbsp;long time ago. For example, viewers note Renner’s roles in&nbsp;films like <i>S.W.A.T.</i>, <i>The Hurt Locker</i>, <i>The Town</i>, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p><h2>Channing Tatum</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d79/ff4/9e152d52388156696a15203f64.jpg><p><a href=# title="Channing Tatum" data-link=tag>Channing Tatum</a> may <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>seem</a> like just a&nbsp;muscular heartthrob who stepped out of&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;models and dancers and into the movies. However, in&nbsp;reality, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;capable of&nbsp;performing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;roles.</p><p>In&nbsp;recent years, audiences have been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>surprised</a> by&nbsp;the actor’s comedic talent, which was hidden from their view for a&nbsp;long time. When the movie<i> 21&nbsp;Jump Street</i> was released, people were impressed with how well Tatum fit into the film’s blend of&nbsp;action and <a href=# title=comedy data-link=tag>comedy</a>. And in&nbsp;<i>Foxcatcher</i>, the actor suddenly won fans over with his dramatic abilities.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, one of&nbsp;Tatum’s recent works, the 2022 film <i>The Lost City</i>, once again made audiences applaud the actor. Channing was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>called</a> the “main source of&nbsp;laughter” in&nbsp;the movie.</p><p><h2>Anna Kendrick</h2></p><p>Despite Anna Kendrick not having <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>many</a> prestigious film awards, it&nbsp;doesn’t stop audiences from loving her. Many consider her a&nbsp;worthy actress, capable of&nbsp;delivering great performances in&nbsp;both comedies, dramas, and even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>musicals</a>. In&nbsp;fact, some people even have Kendrick at&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>top</a> of&nbsp;their list of&nbsp;favorite actors. Nevertheless, she is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;those gems that usually goes unnoticed at&nbsp;first.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/088/98f/24899c587e9944a526b83df849.jpg><p>For example, after the release of&nbsp;the movie <i>A&nbsp;Simple Favor</i>, it&nbsp;seemed like Blake Lively had all the attention on&nbsp;her. After all, her character was the main mystery of&nbsp;the film. Critics even called her a&nbsp;femme <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fatale</a> and a&nbsp;new Hitchcockian blonde.</p><p>However, audiences loved Anna Kendrick’s performance just as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>much</a>. Many found her work in&nbsp;the film charming and brilliant. Some even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that Kendrick’s acting gets better with each new film. By&nbsp;the way, among critics, there were those who <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>considered</a> Anna the true star of&nbsp;the movie.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Our editorial team shares their favorite artists who they consider to&nbsp;be&nbsp;underrated.</h2></p><ul><li><strong>Michael Sheen</strong> is&nbsp;perhaps not the first actor who comes to&nbsp;mind when you think of&nbsp;A-list performers, but he&nbsp;is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;very intriguing artist. There is&nbsp;something in&nbsp;Sheen that sets him apart from other actors. Even in&nbsp;the <i>Twilight</i> saga, where his role is&nbsp;not particularly large or&nbsp;dramatic, he&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;add a&nbsp;unique touch to&nbsp;his character. I’m not sure anyone else could have played Aro Volturi as&nbsp;interestingly and brought attention to&nbsp;this character.<br>By&nbsp;the way, Sheen also has an&nbsp;incredible comedic talent. I&nbsp;was just cracking up&nbsp;watching him in&nbsp;<i>Laws of&nbsp;Attraction</i>. However, I&nbsp;was surprised to&nbsp;learn that Sheen has never won an&nbsp;Oscar.</li><li>I’m sorry to&nbsp;see that such a&nbsp;wonderful actress as&nbsp;<strong>Mary Stuart Masterson</strong> seems to&nbsp;have been somewhat forgotten lately. In&nbsp;her youth, she was quite popular but then began to&nbsp;appear in&nbsp;films less frequently. Yet Masterson is&nbsp;capable of&nbsp;portraying very genuine and sincere heroines. I&nbsp;recall how realistically she played a&nbsp;character suffering from schizophrenia in&nbsp;<i>Benny &&nbsp;Joon</i>. I&nbsp;truly empathized with her character.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c5/290/070bd95e37813fa1eab773db8c.jpg><ul><li>I&nbsp;like <strong>Logan Lerman</strong>. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;no&nbsp;less talented than all the hyped-up actors. He&nbsp;did a&nbsp;great job in&nbsp;<i>Fury</i>. Recently, a&nbsp;movie came out with him in&nbsp;it&nbsp;called <i>Bullet Train</i>. He&nbsp;doesn’t have the main role, but in&nbsp;my&nbsp;opinion, Lerman performed it&nbsp;so&nbsp;well that he&nbsp;should be&nbsp;given more opportunities in&nbsp;the film industry.</li><li>I&nbsp;believe that <strong>Johnny Depp</strong> is&nbsp;greatly underrated. Yes, he&nbsp;has appeared in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;well-known projects, worked with renowned directors, and is&nbsp;incredibly popular. But I&nbsp;think that many people are skeptical of&nbsp;the actor, believing that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;only famous due to&nbsp;hype and doesn’t actually act, just poses and grimaces. However, I&nbsp;see true acting talent in&nbsp;him.<br>Depp skillfully immerses himself in&nbsp;his roles and literally overflows with emotions, switching from immense joy to&nbsp;deep sadness and back again in&nbsp;just a&nbsp;few seconds. And, by&nbsp;the way, he&nbsp;isn’t only suited for playing oddball characters like Jack Sparrow or&nbsp;Willy Wonka, as&nbsp;many people tend to&nbsp;think. Depp can deliver great <a href=# title=drama data-link=tag>drama</a> too! If&nbsp;you don’t believe&nbsp;me, just watch <i>What’s Eating Gilbert Grape</i>. I&nbsp;really don’t understand why Johnny hasn’t won an&nbsp;Oscar yet.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a75/b45/459a675e7daeccddd5b07a2539.jpg><ul><li>I&nbsp;can’t say that <strong>Tom Cruise</strong> is&nbsp;my&nbsp;favorite actor. In&nbsp;the past, my&nbsp;friends and&nbsp;I even questioned his talent. We&nbsp;thought he&nbsp;was just some actor for action movies like <i>Mission: Impossible</i>.<br>But then&nbsp;I saw Cruise in&nbsp;<i>Interview with the Vampire</i> and was amazed. He&nbsp;really transforms himself and you believe him. In&nbsp;the final scenes of&nbsp;the movie, Cruise’s performance even brought me&nbsp;to&nbsp;tears.</li></ul><p>Hollywood is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;talented actresses and actors that, for some reason, don’t get enough of&nbsp;the spotlight:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xedSnm56qopbBprCMmpqtp6Koeri0zmabnquVp8OmecyoqZ5lo6W8tbjIoJ%2BtZaSdrq9506GcsmWXmsFuhJBrbm5qXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./une-etude-de-kpmg-fait-le-point-sur-la-mise-en-oeuvre-et-la-perception-des-cpom.html><span>←</span><span>Une tude de KPMG fait le point sur la mise en uvre et la perception des Cpom</span></a>
