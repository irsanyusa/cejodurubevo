The three layers are gapped and vented. This is to allow for pressure equalization and to prevent the windows from fogging. The material used to make the windows is rather durable and, following federal regulations, won't splinter when damaged.</p><p>It's unclear what caused the window to fail on Flight 957.</p><p>Since the windows are essentially made from plexiglass, they aren't bulletproof. However, they rarely fail. And even if they do, modern airliners such as the Boeing 737 used to operate Flight 1380 can survive and land after most depressurization events.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7xaKlmqaTmnyntc2apZydXZa7sMDHnqlmr5mjsbDDjKilZpldqLy2wMewnKysXaW5orrEZp%2Baq12brqq4xJ1km62kYq6qvs%2BlmKedXay2r7DOsKpmmaKafKnCz52vcHE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-story-of-pierce-brosnan-that-shows-how-a-single-father-managed-to-find-happiness-again-805786.html><span>←</span><span>A Story of Pierce Brosnan That Shows How a Single Father Managed to Find Happiness Again</span></a>
