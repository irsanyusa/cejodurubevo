"Rapid weight loss can alter your estrogen-progesterone balance and impact ovulation, therefore causing your periods to become more irregular."</p><p>But period irregularity isn't your only cause for concern on the keto diet-your period could even stop altogether.</p><p>"Women who lose weight rapidly or become very thin can become amenorrheic, meaning no periods, due to anovulation, or a lack of ovulation," says Chaudhari.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Keep in mind, though, that this is likely due to rapid weight loss that may happen on the keto diet-but it's not exclusive to the keto diet. "This can also occur due to a very low-calorie diet, excessive exercise, or having a very low BMI," says Chaudhari. "This can cause some hormones in your brain that regulate ovulation to drop, and therefore prevent ovulation or delay ovulation leading to menstrual irregularity."</p><p>Another period issue on the keto diet: the lack of carbs.</p><p>"The evidence is very limited, but extreme carbohydrate restriction may lead to changes in the lutenizing hormone, a hormone released from the brain," says Chaudhari. When the body's functioning normally, the lutenizing hormone contributes to regular ovulation, says Chaudhari; but when carbs are restricted-and the lutenizing hormone is compromised-it may cause amenorrhea or hypomenorrhea (short, light periods).</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-8>Is it all bad news? Can the keto do anything good for my cycle?</h3></p><p>Actually, it might: The keto diet may be helpful to women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder that prevents the ovaries from developing or releasing eggs, according to the&nbsp;Office on Women's Health.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"There is emerging data that patients with PCOS, who usually have issues with fertility, [may help] restore regular periods and might help with fertility by making the patient more responsive to fertility treatments," says&nbsp;Ula Abed Alwahab, M.D., an endocrinologist at the Cleveland Clinic.</p><p>That's because, with PCOS, excess insulin in a woman's body also increases her androgen and testosterone levels, which then limits her estrogen production and the body's ability to ovulate.</p><p>The keto diet, however, can help decrease inflammation and insulin resistance, which can be to blame for higher than usual insulin levels seen in PCOS patients, says Alwahab.</p><p>Losing weight on the keto diet can also help PCOS symptoms.</p><p>"Weight loss is recommended for all women with PCOS and the ketogenic diet can be one method to help achieve weight-loss goals," says Chaudhari. "By having a healthier BMI, women are more likely to ovulate regularly leading to more regular periods."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>But, as with any diet, it's important to discuss going keto with your doctor before you do it-especially when you're dealing with a medical issue like PCOS.</p><p>And instead of focusing on a specific diet, like the keto diet, it's most important to find a sustainable and healthy diet that helps you maintain a healthy weight-and ultimately, a stable period, says Chaudhari.</p><p>"Patients who eat healthy, well-rounded diets and maintain normal BMIs are more likely to have regular ovulatory cycles," says Chaudhari.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZMSwucSnqmaglZa5tbSOoKCrpF2ouqK%2B06xknJmeYsGpsYyknK2nXZm2psCMrJqrnadixKrAx2awqK2iYr2mvsiom2ikkqHFdb2V</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bridgerton-season-3-part-2-review-1236015585.html><span>←</span><span>Bridgerton Season 3 Part 2 Is the Most Fascinating Chapter of the Franchise Yet: TV Revi</span></a>
