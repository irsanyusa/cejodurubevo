These species may vary in terms of behaviour, habits, and appearance. Many are grey, some species have various patterns of black and white, and a few are even pink.

In most cases, their skin turns pink as they mature.</li><li><strong>The Ganges river dolphin: </strong>These species are also found in <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/1558407-famous-rivers-world-learned-school/ href=#>freshwater rivers</a> in India.

It's best known for its panda-like black-and-white colour pattern.</li><li><strong>Risso's dolphin: </strong>This type of species loves deeper waters.</li><li><strong>Killer whales: </strong>These are the world's largest dolphins. They typically have a bold black-and-white pattern similar to Commerson's dolphin.</li><li><strong>Spinner dolphins: </strong>Spinners are known for high jumping spins they take out of the water.

The mother gives milk to her children. Sons and daughters of resident orcas remain with their mother's family for the rest of their lives.</li><li>They consume crabs, squid, and fish. Before swallowing, they may break the meal into tiny bits rather than chewing it.</li><li>For smaller dolphin species like orcas, these mammals can live up to 20 years, but for larger dolphin species, their lifespan can reach 80 years or longer.</li><li>The bottlenose dolphins are relatively slow swimmers, travelling at about two mph. They can, however, reach speeds of over 30 mph for brief periods.</li><li>They produce bubbles when hunting. This enables them to herd their prey to the surface. They sometimes also use their tail to hit fish and stun them - making them easier to catch.</li><li>They sleep with one half of their brain at a time while keeping an eye open. They do this to stick together and to look out for predators like sharks.</li><li>Fishing gear is a significant threat to dolphins. Anglers can attach acoustic alarms, or pingers, to fishing nets to avoid this.</li><li>Their teeth are perfect for grasping food, but they aren't made for chewing at all.</li><li>They may eat between 17 and 35 pounds of food a day.</li><li>They stick with their mothers for a long time.</li><li>They have two stomachs. One is used for food storage, and the other for digestion.</li><li>They are known to be great divers. They can dive up to 1,000 feet underwater.</li><li>They help the sick and injured members of their groups.</li><li>Killer whales belong to the dolphin family. They reach up to a length of 30 feet and are the biggest of their kind.</li><li>They can migrate if their food needs are not met. They will move to places with enough food and the climatic conditions that suit their body temperatures.</li><li>Their delicate skins get injured at the slightest touch of a hard surface. Due to their fast healing attribute, even the deepest wounds can be healed quickly.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5d7f500c1dc9674b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Smartest bird: top 10 most intelligent species in the world</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9aacd730b698495b.jpg><h2 id=1577242-are-dolphins-mean class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Are dolphins mean?</h2><p class=align-left>In some situations, dolphins have been known to attack humans and other marine mammals when they feel threatened or are highly stressed, which may make them look mean.</p><h2 id=1577242-are-dolphins-vicious class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Are dolphins vicious?</h2><p class=align-left>They are not inherently vicious.
