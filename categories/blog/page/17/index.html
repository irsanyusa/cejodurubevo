Juste avant la clôture de la session extraordinaire précédant la pause estivale, mercredi 23 juillet, le Parlement a adopté définitivement, par un ultime vote de l'Assemblée, le projet de loi de finances rectificative (PLFR) et le projet de loi de financement rectificative de la sécurité sociale (PLFRSS). Ces deux textes ont été présentés comme amorçant la traduction législative du pacte avec les entreprises annoncé par François Hollande le 14 janvier. Ils visent donc à la fois à réduire le déficit public et à améliorer la compétitivité des entreprises avec l'espoir de relancer par ricochet l'emploi.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Best Celebrity Cameos on 'How I Met Your Mother'</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../taylor-swift-track-five-songs-tortured-poets-department.html></a>
One thing is always for sure with Taylor Swift: her most devastating songs will always be the fifth track on her albums. It’s a pattern that fans have noticed since 2012's Red. The fifth song on that album, widely regarded as her magnum opus, is “All Too Well.” But even looking at the albums before Red, the pattern was already there. In an Instagram Live she did before the release of Lover, Swift spoke about the phenomenon and admitted she didn’t really notice she was doing it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What to know about Africa Day</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../weight-loss-drugs-compounding-pharmacies.html></a>
With social media fueling the huge demand for drugs like Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy, and Mounjaro, which are helping people to lose more weight than any previous weight loss medications, it’s no surprise that manufacturers have had trouble keeping up. And the recent approval of Eli Lilly's Zepbound, which is the same drug, Mounjaro, approved already for diabetes, but renamed specifically for weight management, will only add to that demand. Novo Nordisk, which makes Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus, for example, has intentionally held back the release of new starter doses of Wegovy to ensure that those who have already started on the weight loss drug can continue getting their injections despite the current limited availability and manufacturing schedules.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Boston Police Department under fire for honoring legendary Celtics coach Red Auerbach for Black Hist</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>

On July 4th, America’s 300 million citizens will mark the 234th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The holiday weekend that’s famous for fireworks, barbecues and apple pie is increasingly being used as an occasion for tens of thousands of Americans that identify as “hard-core” war reenactors to wear outfits made from 19th century fabric adorned with arcane military pins.
