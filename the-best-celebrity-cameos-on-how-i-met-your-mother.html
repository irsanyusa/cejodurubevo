It’s no secret that there were tons of celebrity cameos on the CBS sitcom series, How I Met Your Mother, so let’s look back and remember them.</strong></p><p>I recently finished How I Met Your Mother for the first time (no shame here!) and was shocked at all of the celebrity cameos in the series. Since I just finished my first watch, I do have to include a <strong>SPOILER WARNING</strong>. This article may contain spoilers, so please refrain from reading, if you have not finished the series.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-best-celebrity-cameos-on-how-i-met-your-mother>The Best Celebrity Cameos on How I Met Your Mother</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Carrie Underwood</h2><p>Although <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie Underwood</a> had a very short appearance on How I Met Your Mother, it was quite iconic. She appeared in season five’s episode, Hooked. As Tiffany, the singer strung along the main character Ted Mosby, since she was dating him, but still together with her boyfriend.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Jennifer Lopez</h2><p>Jennifer Lopez also had a small, yet iconic run on How I Met Your Mother. She also appeared on the show’s fifth season, in episode 17 “Of Course.” Soon after Robin Scherbatsky and Barney Stinson’s breakup, Robin hooks Barney up with a relationship writer (Anita, played by Lopez), that probably wouldn’t sleep with him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Heidi Klum</h2><p>Supermodel <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heidi Klum</a> appeared in season three, as herself. In the episode “The Yips” Klum appeared at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show after-party. At the after party, she met Ted, Barney, and their other friend, Marshall Eriksen. She helps Barney with his dating problems.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Britney Spears</h2><p>Superstar Britney Spears was a great recurring character on How I Met Your Mother. She appeared in season three episodes, Ten Sessions and Everything Must Go as Abby. Abby is the receptionist for Ted’s dermatologist, whom he’s trying to ask out. Although her character has a thing for Ted, she decides to sleep with Barney.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Nicole Scherzinger</h2><p>It’s no secret that one of the best side plots of the storyline was Robin’s secret past as Robin Sparkles. In season six, Robin’s New York friends look into her Canadian past in “Glitter.” While looking into her past, they find her ex best friend, Jessica Glitter (played by Nicole Scherzinger).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Katy Perry</h2><p>Even though <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katy Perry</a> only appeared in one episode, she had one of the most memorable characters. In season six, Perry appeared as Zoey’s (Ted’s girlfriend) cousin, Honey in “Oh Honey.” The entire episode is basically all about how Honey is beautiful, yet naïve. Honey was one of the most funny extra characters on the show, in my opinion.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Wayne Brady</h2><p>The absolute goat had to be number one on the list. Wayne Brady had such a recurring role on this series, he played James Stinson, Barney’s gay older brother. Although Brady was only in 14 episodes, his character is so impactful to Barney that he’s mentioned a ton. James’ marriage is the outline for Barney’s future, and what he wants to accomplish someday. Since both men grew up with a single mother and no father, they relied on each other for most things, and that really comes across in the series.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_JoeJonasNickJonas_Mariano-RegidorRedferns-220x147.jpeg alt="Joe Jonas Admits He Was “So Jealous” When Nick Landed ‘The Voice’ Gig" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZpqVqMFur8SlnJuqmanGbq%2FAppyoq12ku260zrBkomWdmsFuxc6uqWaln6m1pr6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./les-budgets-rectificatifs-definitivement-adoptes.html><span>←</span><span>Les budgets rectificatifs dfinitivement adopts</span></a>
