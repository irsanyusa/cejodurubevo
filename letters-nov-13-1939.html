The dog has gallantly bitten two of them, but they have retaliated by reporting him to the police. We are thinking of resorting to stink bombs! We have five people living with us, and are getting our family life organized on a communist basis. Daddy hates every minute of it, but mother has risen to the occasion like an old war horse. After all, she dates from the Franco-Prussian War, so this is nothing new to her. By the way, why isn’t America in this scrap?

I was mobilised with my Women’s Auxiliary Fire Service on the 1st, and to my horror discovered all arrangements had been changed, and that we had to live at the Fire Station in the most vile discomfort. In fact things got so impossible we all resigned in a body, but improvements were promised and are actually in hand, so that I suppose gradually conditions will improve. The first night I slept on a table, but now on a camp bed & a sleeping bag, as, after being perfectly sickeningly hot, it has turned icy cold. We are five in a room, but hope that will be altered as there is no room to move and until I went home and got a tin jug & basin for our room, 24 women had to wash at the kitchen sink, amongst the cooking & washing up! It really was the limit and I thought I should really have to chuck it. It wasn’t so much the discomfort as the feeling one was a prisoner, but now we are getting 48 hours on duty and 24 hours off which has very much changed the situation. The bulk of the girls are youngsters; of course I get fearfully tired of spending hours with the very young but I daresay they feel just the same about the aged. [N.B.—The writer is over 40.] I enjoyed my first leave tremendously and went into the country to see Mother. Lots of our friends are drifting back to town through sheer boredom. I fancy I shall be mentally deficient when the war does end. This sort of pottering about is quite destructive to the brain and one can’t settle to anything never knowing when one will be called out. . .</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As ever,</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">J.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">>To many another who sent letters from abroad, TIME’S warmest thanks. —ED.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">hitler</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sirs:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yes, by all means: “hitler” should be an improper noun as designated!</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">F.

I merely wish to say that I have no control over anybody’s personal opinion. Nor is that particular feature in his report the one that motivates this letter. What I have in mind is a certain very important inaccuracy—albeit undoubtedly an inadvertent one—in your article: your correspondent said that I obtained my finances from the “antilabor overlords” of Milwaukee. That is not true even in the very slightest degree! And if ever it becomes necessary for me to prove it I can do so beyond any doubt. Of course, many merchants, manufacturers, bankers and other businessmen bought tickets in blocks of fives (the series) to see the plays I produced in Milwaukee. But so did many doctors, lawyers, bookkeepers and stenographers. But neither the series, nor To the End of Time was sponsored or financed in the manner your article described.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As regards the statement that the Milwaukee critics “booted the play around.” That is quite true—but there are several vital reasons for that which have absolutely nothing to do with the merits or demerits of the play.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As to the mention of the half-empty houses: both legitimate theatres in Milwaukee are huge 1,600-seat houses, and with very few exceptions, no attraction that plays Milwaukee can boast of even half-empty houses. A half-capacity audience in Milwaukee is a distinct compliment to a play. . . .</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">MYRON C.

It is our destiny, it is each of us who is concerned—you said presently—it is the survival of our civilisation that is at stake, and this night when the terrible news of such a cataclysm reaches us will be forever la noche triste. And our whole household was in tears. Next day, Rio de Janeiro, almost a desert, silent, immersed in melancholy, looked like a cemetery. And the Press unanimously expressed this bitter sorrow of our Christian people. Now, look here, Dad, what this American paper, the very paper we like so much, dared to say against us Brazilians.” And presently he stretched out TIME, Sept. 11, and there, almost unbelieving the testimony of my eyes, I began to read, under the epigraphs Latin America, Death for Sale:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“In four continents of the world there was bitter sorrow last week over War. But in the fifth, the carrot-shaped continent, there was frank rejoicing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“South America’s reaction to the conflict was almost entirely economic, almost entirely bullish. . . .”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The parrot eats our crops”—my son interrupted my reading—”and poor parakeet gets an ill name. . . .

Beware, as injustice always begets injustice. . . .”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I returned to the reading of [Burckhardt’s] wonderful chapter on the morality and religion of Italian people during Renaissance:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It may be possible to indicate many contrasts and shades of difference among different nations, but to strike the balance of the whole is not given to human insight. The ultimate truth with respect to the character, the conscience, and the guilt of a people remains forever a secret; if only for the reason that its defects have another side, where they reappear as peculiarities or even as virtues. We must leave those who find a pleasure in passing sweeping censures on whole nations to do so as they like.
