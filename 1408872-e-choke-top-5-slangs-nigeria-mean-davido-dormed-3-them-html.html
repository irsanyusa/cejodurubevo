Soro Soke</h2><p class=align-left>The Yoruba words "soro soke" which translate as "talk audibly" is <a id="https://www.legit.ng/1374985-nollywood-actress-lola-idije-internet-sensation-slogan-soro-soke.html#:~:text=Veteran%20Nollywood%20actress%2C%20Toyin%20Afolayan,that%20youths%20can%20identify%20with." href=#>associated with a veteran Nigerian actress, Toyin Afolayan</a>, before it took a life of its own during the 2020 EndSARS protest.</p><p class=align-left>The words became a multi-dimensional mantra. Sometimes, it could be used to urge someone to be loud enough with their request or a way to tell a person in authority to be audible when making promises to resolve a situation.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5f91c875c002cccb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Up NEPA: Children jubilate loudly in the street as electricity is restored to Maiduguri after '56 days'</span></p></a><h2>2. We Move</h2><p class=align-left>This is another slang that was popularised by the protest. They are chant words that speak of people's resilience in a dire situation, telling whoever cares to listen that the struggle continues no matter what was done to hold them back</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5f91c875c002cccb.jpg><h2>3. E choke</h2><p class=align-left>Popular Nigerian musician, <a href=#>Davido</a>, influenced the words. While they could mean different things, "e choke" could be used when something turns out amazingly well. The singer said he is <a href=#>considering copywriting the slogan</a>.</p><h2>4. Tule</h2><p class=align-left>This is a Yoruba word that means "release", "set free", or "unpack". The Holy Ground crooner also introduced this when he said "tule jare" in a video. To sound hippy, you could use "tule" as a way to tell someone it is high time they set out on something or released a thing.</p><h2>5. Who dey breet?</h2><p class=align-left>While it could be hard to pin meanings to this slang, Davido first used it on Sunday, March 14, hours after <a href=#>Wizkid</a> and Burna Boy clinched their Grammy awards. It literally means "who is breathing?"</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e900eaf72031e0c9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nollywood actor Bolanle Ninalowo excited as he hits 4 million followers on Instagram</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Download our mobile app to enjoy the latest news update</a></p><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, <strong>Legit.ng </strong>earlier reported that Davido left many people amused after he took to his <a href=#>Instagram page to share his latest post</a> on his lifestyle</p><p class=align-left>The Jowo crooner posted a photo of himself sitting in what appears to be an expensive automobile.</p><p class=align-left><strong>---</strong></p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Joseph Omotayo writes for the human interest desk at Legit.ng.
