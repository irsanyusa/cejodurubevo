The Canadian singer collaborated with hybrid persona Anyma to create the futuristic music piece.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Grimes Releases ‘Welcome To The Opera’ Alongside Anyma</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grimes</a> debuted the song back in May 2022 during her DJ set at Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas. At the time, the dance-pop artist made a condition that she’ll be dropping a demo of the song if Anyma will collaborate with her. She also stated that she’s not yet satisfied with her output as she still needed to edit and finalize the song.</p><p>Now, after almost a year of working on the track, the duo has finally released its official version. Grimes and Anyma also shared a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">complementary visualizer</a> which includes a sci-fi fantasy to it.</p><p>Showing off her non-AI-generated voice, Grimes took fans to a dainty and ethereal world through their music video. Coupled with Anyma’s synth-heavy beats, the futuristic track has become more enchanting and sublime.</p><p>“Welcome to the Opera” is now available to stream on Spotify and Apple Music.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-thinks-spotify-should-have-an-ai-section>She Thinks Spotify Should Have an AI Section</h2><p>In an episode of UTOPIA Talks podcast, Grimes talked <a href=#>A</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I</a> and the voice of artists being used by others. According to the singer, consent should always be an issue when dealing with matters in music like that.</p><p>“I think it’s good to have consent,” she said. “It wouldn’t personally bother me, but I just still think it’s good to respect people, like if they don’t want that… It is a lot, you are like foregoing creative control. And so you sort of have to be like open to that. I think there’s systems that can make it a bit easier.”</p><p>Grimes has also stated that she believes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a> and other streaming services should have a dedicated section for AI. She then mentioned her plan of petitioning the streaming platform for the potentiality of her suggestion.</p><p>“Like if they made also an AI section, then it would be easier to like to compartmentalize that stuff,” she said.</p><p>As stated by Grimes, having an AI section on Spotify would give more way for quality control. She also said that it would be less confusing for fans to spot AI music from manually generated ones.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_CherylHines_Michael-Becker-FOX-220x147.jpeg alt="‘I Can See Your Voice’s Cheryl Hines Supports Husband Robert F.
