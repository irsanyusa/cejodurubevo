Mobolaji Johnson street, Oregun Alausa, Ikeja.</p><p>Speaking in his defence during Thursday’s proceedings, Nwude who was led in evidence by defence counsel, Mr <strong>Chuks Nwachukwu</strong>, denied knowledge of the source of the funds from the 242 million dollars airport scam.</p><p>According to him, when he was standing trial for the 242 million dollars scam, he was approached by a member of his legal team, Dr <strong>Chris Uche</strong> (SAN) in prison who suggested that he makes a plea bargain agreement with the EFCC.</p><p>He said Uche had advised that he would make the plea bargain agreement like what was done for <strong>Amaka Anajemba</strong> (one of his co-defendants in the fake airport scam) so that he would not be solely made to repay the funds to the victims.</p><p>He said he refused Uche’s offer because the funds found in his account by the anti-graft agency were not proceeds of fraud.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“I told him that I’m not responsible for the 242 million dollars. That I’m not responsible for this money, I don’t know anything about it.</p><p>“The EFCC should check all the remittances that came through my accounts, though, I have my friend late <strong>Christian Anajemba</strong>’s (husband of Amaka, his co-defendant) various bank accounts.</p><p>“As money came to my accounts, I gave it to one of my Indian friends, Mr <strong>Naresh Asnani</strong>, who has contact with a Swiss bank, who in turn does the exchange for me.</p><p>“When the money comes in, he (Asnani) took his commission and I’ll take my commission and I give the large sum to Christian Anajemba,” Nwude said.</p><p>Nwude also accused a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr <strong>Olisa Agbakoba</strong>, of abandoning him two weeks after he collected N27 million out of the N30 million fee he charged him for legal representation during his trial for the 242 million scam.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“After Mr<strong> G.O. K. Ajayi </strong>(SAN), I brought in Olisa Agbakoba (SAN) to stand for me.</p><p>“I have never been in court before, I never had experience of court. When I brought Agbakoba, he charged me N30 million and I paid him N27 million.</p><p>“Two weeks later Agbakoba asked me to bring more money and I said no because I just paid him N27 million. He said he wanted the money to pursue an appeal.</p><p>“He said if I did not pay the balance he would not appear in my matter again. I told him to go to hell.</p><p>“On the next adjournment, he refused to come and I was stranded in court, then EFCC introduced Mr<strong> Ricky Tarfa</strong> (SAN) to me,” Nwude said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Justice <strong>Mojisola Dada</strong> adjourned the case until May 24 for continuation of trial.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXyjwdKipZ6ro6Kur3nWoaZmr5GoeqS7za%2BgnKyVmXqnu9Fmm6iknJa%2Fc4CRpmSaoaKlvLPAjKyamqVdqK66v4yhnKxlpaOuuK3RnmSonl2ovLa%2Bwp5mnamWbMNyvg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./16-women-who-gained-confidence-after-embracing-their-body-hair-810582.html><span>←</span><span>17 Women Who Gained Confidence After Embracing Their Body Hair</span></a>
