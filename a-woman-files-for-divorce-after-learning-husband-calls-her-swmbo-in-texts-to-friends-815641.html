Their son was 2&nbsp;years old at&nbsp;that time, and the woman just didn’t see it&nbsp;coming.</p><p>Though, in&nbsp;her post she admits that she should have, saying, “From the moment our son was born, nothing changed for my&nbsp;husband. He&nbsp;absolutely hated telling me&nbsp;what his plans were.” She described her husband’s “stubborn reluctance to&nbsp;tell&nbsp;us when he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;our lives.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/25a/812/4b36ce5fbb824a4797a4a7fc77.jpg><p>Curiosity seized her one <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>morning</a> when her husband’s phone produced non-stop sounds as&nbsp;he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;the shower. She had a&nbsp;wish to&nbsp;check if&nbsp;there wasn’t anything urgent, and picked up&nbsp;the phone only to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;group chat where her husband and his pals were planning a&nbsp;night out.</p><p>She discovered that her husband had turned down his friends’ invitation for going out. Her spouse blamed it&nbsp;on&nbsp;her, but even this wasn’t the crux of&nbsp;the issue. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his messages, he&nbsp;wrote, “Don’t think&nbsp;I can make it&nbsp;tonight. <strong>SWMBO will say&nbsp;no</strong>.”</p><p><h2>The nickname turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very hurtful for the appalled woman.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5fd/046/6b23dd500ab81ecddea754db0d.jpg><p>The woman was bemused and had a&nbsp;reasonable <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>question</a> about what did ‘SWMBO’ mean. She supposed it&nbsp;alluded to&nbsp;her, but wanted to&nbsp;know its meaning.</p><p>She wrote, “And also&nbsp;— he&nbsp;hadn’t asked me&nbsp;about that night, so&nbsp;I was annoyed he’d blamed it&nbsp;on&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;went into the bathroom with the phone and asked my&nbsp;husband what ‘SWMBO’ meant. He&nbsp;wasn’t mad I’d looked at&nbsp;his phone. He&nbsp;was totally unmoved by&nbsp;having to&nbsp;explain the message to&nbsp;me.” “It&nbsp;means ‘She Who Must Be&nbsp;Obeyed’,” he&nbsp;said, casually.</p><p>The woman wrote, “I&nbsp;felt like I’d been slapped in&nbsp;the face.” She explained her reaction, saying, “It&nbsp;wasn’t a&nbsp;matter of ‘obeying’ me, or&nbsp;asking my&nbsp;permission, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;often complained. It’s not called ‘asking permission’ like he’s a&nbsp;teenager, and I’m his mother. It’s called <a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a>. Courtesy in&nbsp;checking to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;you’re needed&nbsp;— to&nbsp;say what your plans are. Otherwise, how is&nbsp;that a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>?”</p><p>And here’s yet another fascinating <a href=#>relationship</a> article, that tells about a&nbsp;woman who used a&nbsp;tampon that she found in&nbsp;her boyfriend’s room to&nbsp;find out if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was cheating on&nbsp;her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uw86mmKdllp65pr%2BMn6arZZSew7C%2Bwp5kmp6kmr9uuMSaqaehnpx6qcHSm5innF2Yrq240mafnqpdqMSurs5moKdlpJrFtb%2BMraZmnqKesq%2Bw0mZvam1maX5w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./remas-calm-down-surpasses-2-billion-spotify-streams.html><span>←</span><span>Rema's 'Calm Down' surpasses 2 billion Spotify streams</span></a>
