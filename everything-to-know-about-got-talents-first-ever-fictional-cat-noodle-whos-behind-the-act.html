Manifesting his fictional presence but sensational talent on stage, Noodle is a cartoon contestant that’s definitely worth looking forward to in this season of America’s Got Talent.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Noodle is an Anonymous Singing Artificial Cat&nbsp;</h2><p>Aged six (according to his lower third) when he joined <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Britain’s Got Talent</a> season 16, Noodle is an unexpected contestant of the show. Nonetheless, he quickly made a powerful impression when he sang a pre-recorded rendition of “Feeling Good” by Nina Simone.</p><p>Before his audition, he declared that he wanted to become the first cat to ever perform for the Royal family. His identity was never revealed until the Semi-Finals, where he sang “Live and Let Die” by Paul McCartney. During the semifinals, Noodle was revealed as BGT season 15 third placer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Ball</a>, this totally shocked everyone.</p><p>Prior to BGT, Noodle had quite made a name for himself. He first tasted fame in 2020 through online videos focused around him, his friend Bun, and their misadventures. Subsequently, Noodle joined France’s Got Talent, and was originally anonymous as well. His identity was later revealed to be FGT season 11 runner-up Mickaël Dos Santos.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-got-talent-fans-are-divided-over-noodle-s-identity>Got Talent Fans are Divided Over Noodle’s Identity</h2><p>While it has been refreshing and amusing to see a fictional cat sing, several Got Talent fans have reservations with Noodle’s actual identity. During the cat’s BGT stint, fans thought his voice shouldn’t be Tom Ball’s. Such sentiment was particularly expressed by many fans, believing that the chance should be given to a more deserving contestant.</p><p>“Tom ball is honestly an amazing singer but he was 3rd last year, then he did agt champions show and now he’s back again?? seems a bit off,” one person wrote at the time.</p><p>Noodle is set to appear on television once more for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">America’s Got Talent</a> season 18. Since his identity has been revealed in two Got Talent franchises, it’s fair to expect that his personality could be that of a former AGT contestant.</p><p>We’ll never be able to guess unless we see it unfold on screen. If you want to see more of Noodle, be sure to tune in on America’s Got Talent season 18 on NBC, Tuesday, at 8 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Original_DuoAcero_Trae-PattonNBC-220x147.jpeg alt="Meet Duo Acero, The Acrobatic Powerhouse Set to Amaze on ‘AGT’ Season 18" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xK%2Bcq7Gknbavs4ytpmajnqTEbq3BqKytZZekwW7AwKWcp6yjYrOqvtKtZJ6ulad6p7XCraCoppGheqSt02alqKeUobJuw8eoqmaalZ22r7CMrZ%2BeZZGYwXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./apres-la-protection-de-lenfance-la-pression-monte-pour-demander-un-ministere-delegue-aux-personnes.html><span>←</span><span>Aprs la protection de l'enfance, la pression monte pour demander un ministre dlgu aux pers</span></a>
