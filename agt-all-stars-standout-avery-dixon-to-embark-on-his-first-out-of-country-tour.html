Apparently, the conversation led the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Atlanta saxophonist</a> to secure a trip to Spain and an opportunity to show off his musicality to foreign audiences.</p><p>“I got the chance to connect with him through Instagram and he asked me to be a guest musician on May 2023, Dave Koz at Sea Cruise to Spain,” he said. “So I’d like to announce my official first trip out of the country.”</p><p>Seconds prior to his big announcement, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dixon</a> admitted that he’s been a huge fan of Koz for a long time. Since he’s such a huge fan of the fellow musician, he considered this opportunity “over the moon.”</p><p>At the moment, all of the dates of Koz’s May tour are already sold out. Dixon will be performing on those dates in both Morocco and Portugal. It seems like this experience will be great for the young saxophone player, since the crowds will be completely filled.</p><p>Apart from the Sea Cruise tour, Dixon has also booked several gigs through his mom-slash-manager Lisa. Nonetheless, the saxophonist is still open for more offers, hoping to fill his calendar in the coming months.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Performed ‘September’ During AGT All-Stars Finale</h2><p>Back in season 17 of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">America’s Got Talent</a>, Dixon landed in the Final show but nonetheless failed to secure the biggest prize. This year, he came back for AGT All-Stars more determined to pocket the prestigious title and prize money. The saxophonist recently performed as a finalist in the spin-off series, competing against 10 other remaining contestants.</p><p>Last Monday, Dixon captured the crowd when he played his own version of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“September” by Earth, Wind & Fire</a>. He went on stage with an accompanying band and completely energized the audience with their amazing act.</p><p>Upon witnessing the act, music mogul Simon Cowell called it “astonishing.” Meanwhile, Heidi Klum reflected how Dixon always manages to rise to the occasion while Howie Mandel stated that he was the “most improved” contestant in the show.</p><p>Next week’s Finale will reveal the winner of the first ever season of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT All-Stars</a>. If you want to see who will win the ultimate title of being the best of the best, be sure to tune in on the spin-off series next Monday on NBC, Peacock, or fuboTV.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_CanadasGotTalent_SneakPeek2-1-220x147.jpg alt="‘Canada’s Got Talent’ Act Horrifies the Judges in New Sneak Peek" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZpmcoXq0wMCrqmarpJa7pbvUrWSarpWnxm6wyLGmp2WkpHqmucGaqaRln6N6qbXSZp2iqqOperDB02amn2WTpMKvwNGyZK2npad8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ralph-waite.html><span>←</span><span>Ralph Waite | TIME</span></a>
