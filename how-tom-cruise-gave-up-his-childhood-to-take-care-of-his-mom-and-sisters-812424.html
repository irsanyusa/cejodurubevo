He&nbsp;had to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;significant responsibilities at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age and had to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;his childhood to&nbsp;support his <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>.</p><p>The <a href=#><i>Top Gun</i></a> star <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was born in&nbsp;New York</a> in&nbsp;1962. The son of&nbsp;teacher Mary Lee and engineer Thomas Cruise, he&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;home with three sisters. His family often moved due to&nbsp;his father’s instability&nbsp;— he&nbsp;changed jobs constantly and had a&nbsp;rather explosive character.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d60/7ba/d133145f61a8a29a919f2e6fd3.jpg><p>Jeff Rayner / Coleman-Rayner / East NEWS<span>, </span>Coleman-Rayner / East NEWS</p><p>Tom struggled a&nbsp;lot at&nbsp;school during his childhood, having attended 14&nbsp;different schools and being <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>diagnosed with dyslexia</a> at&nbsp;age seven. Eventually, when he&nbsp;was&nbsp;11, his mother decided to&nbsp;leave his father and settle with her son and daughters in&nbsp;Kentucky. Mary was forced to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;her four children alone and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worked up&nbsp;to&nbsp;three jobs</a> to&nbsp;support the household.</p><p>The actor had developed a&nbsp;very <a href=#>close relationship with his mother</a> and supported her in&nbsp;everything she needed. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mary revealed</a> that her sweet son would go&nbsp;out of&nbsp;his way to&nbsp;make her feel good.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ccb/0fd/eb53d55e28b719a944e80cf265.jpg><p>MySpace / EAST NEWS</p><p>Unfortunately, the stress and workload took a&nbsp;toll on&nbsp;Mary’s health, causing her to&nbsp;develop a&nbsp;herniated disc. This meant she could no&nbsp;longer <a href=#>take care of&nbsp;her family alone</a>, and a&nbsp;friend had to&nbsp;move in&nbsp;with them to&nbsp;help with the daily chores.</p><p>For a&nbsp;while, the family lived on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>food stamps</a>. In&nbsp;addition, Tom had to&nbsp;mature more quickly than other children. From the age of&nbsp;11, the <i>Mission Impossible</i> star began working to&nbsp;support his mom and sisters. The boy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>delivered newspapers</a>, mowed the lawn at&nbsp;neighbors’ houses, and took cleaning jobs, whatever he&nbsp;could to&nbsp;help out at&nbsp;home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca5/0af/20000759dd8a368d146215588c.jpg><p>Although the relationship between teenagers and their parents can go&nbsp;through some ups and downs, Tom and Mary’s was different. His <a href=#>mother was always his best friend</a>, and he&nbsp;used all the money he&nbsp;earned from his jobs to&nbsp;provide for his family.</p><p>From a&nbsp;young age, Tom had shown interest in&nbsp;acting and was very talented. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;young boy, he&nbsp;would do&nbsp;little sketches of&nbsp;his favorite comedians or&nbsp;imitate animated characters, and his most loyal audience was his mom. So, even though he&nbsp;felt the need to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;her and postpone his dreams, it&nbsp;was Mary who <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>encouraged him to&nbsp;participate</a> in&nbsp;his first play in&nbsp;high school.</p><p>When Tom was&nbsp;16, his mother remarried, so&nbsp;the young man finally felt ready to&nbsp;pursue his dreams in&nbsp;the film industry. At&nbsp;18, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;move to&nbsp;New York and promised Mary and his stepfather, Jack South, that in&nbsp;10&nbsp;years, he&nbsp;would have a&nbsp;successful acting career. They both supported him, and his mother became his guide on&nbsp;his road to&nbsp;success.</p><p>Although Tom earned the recognition of&nbsp;critics and fans in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very short time, it&nbsp;seems that fame never went to&nbsp;the actor’s head, and his strong work ethic has <a href=#>kept him at&nbsp;the top</a> for 40&nbsp;years. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;aware that he&nbsp;owes much of&nbsp;his accomplishments precisely to&nbsp;his mother, who taught him to&nbsp;work hard and be&nbsp;patient and determined.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f3b/35b/8631d353b2880bfabf15146330.jpg><p>Although Cruise is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>’s most influential stars, fame never kept him away from Mary. The actor <a href=#>attended multiple red carpets with her</a> and proudly showed her off whenever he&nbsp;could. Moreover, Tom continues to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;his sisters and nephews, who spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time with him at&nbsp;home.</p><p>Mary Lee <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>passed away in&nbsp;2017</a>, and although her health had deteriorated, and she had moved away from the public eye during the last few years, her legacy in&nbsp;Tom’s heart and career will always remain. The actor kept by&nbsp;her side until the end of&nbsp;her days, and he&nbsp;showed&nbsp;us that one of&nbsp;the greatest joys we&nbsp;can experience is&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=#>repay all the love</a> given to&nbsp;us by&nbsp;our loved ones.</p><p>Tom Cruise’s unique characteristics and achievements set him apart in&nbsp;Hollywood. From refusing stunt doubles to&nbsp;his peculiar relationship with numbers, Cruise’s dedication to&nbsp;his craft and personal quirks make him a&nbsp;standout figure. His <a href=#>commitment to&nbsp;performing his own stunts</a>, such as&nbsp;climbing the Burj Khalifa and suspending himself from a&nbsp;plane, showcases his unparalleled dedication to&nbsp;authenticity in&nbsp;film.</p><p>The sequel to&nbsp;the iconic 1986 film “Top Gun” showcases Tom Cruise’s unwavering <a href=#>commitment to&nbsp;realism</a> in&nbsp;cinema. Opting for real jets over CGI and performing many of&nbsp;his own stunts, Cruise’s dedication to&nbsp;authenticity is&nbsp;evident. The film, “Top Gun: Maverick,” not only revives the charm of&nbsp;the original but also pushes the boundaries of&nbsp;aerial cinematography, capturing the raw intensity of&nbsp;real flight sequences.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;2022 survey by&nbsp;Showcase Cinemas, 2,000 mothers globally crowned Tom Cruise as&nbsp;“<a href=#>the most attractive actor of&nbsp;all time</a>.” The release of&nbsp;“Top Gun: Maverick” has reignited admiration for the 60-year-old star, reminiscent of&nbsp;his heartthrob status from earlier films like “Top Gun” and “Cocktail.” This accolade underscores Cruise’s enduring appeal across generations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4ytpqZlk6fCqr%2FEZp6arpViwrF5x6KqZpuYnrmltM6om2asn2LBorfEZpqaqpVivKd5x6KqZqWfonqiusNmqqKrpJq%2FtHmXamltamRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-andy-bell-musician-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Andy Bell (musician) Make?
