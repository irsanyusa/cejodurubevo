In a recent interview, she described the fellow country singer as her “best friend” and said she’s also close with other people from the show.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-american-idol-s-huntergirl-calls-noah-thompson-her-best-friend>‘American Idol’s HunterGirl Calls Noah Thompson Her Best Friend</h2><p>In an interview with <a href=#>Hollywood Life</a>, HunterGirl was asked if she might ever collaborate with Noah at some point, and she responded, “Hopefully. I hope there is a duet that comes out in the future.”</p><p>“He’s one of my best friends,” HunterGirl continued, “so it would be really cool to see someone come together between the two of us. Stay tuned.”</p><p>The singer also shared that the Top 24 from this season has a group chat going, saying they’re “so close.” She added that she’s “found some best friends for life during this experience,” sharing, “We’ll definitely see each other because I couldn’t imagine not.”</p><p>HunterGirl said the contestants were so supportive of each other throughout the season that it “didn’t feel like a competition.” Even when it came down to the finale, “we were all just like, well, however it goes we are happy with whatever happens.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>‘AMERICAN IDOL’ STAR HUNTERGIRL’S EP SECOND ONLY TO CHAYCE BECKHAM ON ITUNES</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Cd5kitSOWxX/</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-singer-shared-where-her-stage-name-came-from>The Singer Shared Where Her Stage Name Came From</h3><p>HunterGirl also told Hollywood Life the story behind her stage name. Her full name is Hunter Wolkonowski, but people find it hard to pronounce. Since she was the only girl named Hunter at school growing up, the front office worker would say, “The girl Hunter. Hunter Girl, come to the office.”</p><p>“I laugh thinking back on it now,” she said. “And in talent shows, there would be other guys named Hunter in the competition and ‘Wolkonowski’ they couldn’t get it at all. They’d be like, ‘The girl Hunter. Hunter Girl.’ So I was like, ‘Okay, I guess my name is HunterGirl.'”</p><p>The singer currently has a single out called “Red Bird,” and she released an EP earlier this year called One Day, which features her original song “Heartbreak Down.” HunterGirl said she’s excited to write more music and play shows.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NUP_195978_01327.jpg alt="‘The Voice’ Runner-Up Wendy Moten Reunites with Fellow Team Blake Star Lana Scott" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo6xlmKq7tbHRoKCrpF2Yrq240malqJmYYsGpu8ypqqimXZ2ys3nBnqqtZZantqa6w2afqKiVqHq1u4ydrJ6sXay2tbSMoaCmZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./want-to-date-kelly-clarkson-dont-ever-do-this-annoying-thing.html><span>←</span><span>Want To Date Kelly Clarkson?
