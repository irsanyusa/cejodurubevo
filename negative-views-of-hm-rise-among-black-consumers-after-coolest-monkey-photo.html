Since September, Morning Consult has surveyed 3,051 black adults about H&M.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">By comparison, among 20,555 white respondents, favorability averaged about 28 percent before the incident and was little changed at 27 percent afterward, while unfavorability held steady at 8 percent.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Still, it doesn’t appear that H&M is in any danger of losing African-American customers en masse. Favorable views among black consumers slipped 5 points to 42 percent after news stories about the photo, but a greater percentage of African-Americans consistently reports more interest in buying a product from H&M compared to white and Hispanic respondents. Fifty-six percent of black respondents said they were likely to buy from the company, as of Jan. 18.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Among consumers ages 18-29, the age demographic that consistently indicates the most interest in purchasing from H&M, those who said they had an unfavorable impression of H&M more than doubled, from 12 percent on Jan. 8 to 25 percent on Jan. 18.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Millennials who say they would not consider buying H&M products in the future rose from 6 percent on Jan. 8 to 13 percent on Jan. 18. Morning Consult asked 5,419 people ages 18-29 about H&M from Sept. 5 to Jan. 18.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">H&M removed the image from its website and said it would also pull the shirt from its stores worldwide. H&M on Tuesday said it had hired Annie Wu, most recently its global manager for employee relations, for a new position at the company: global head of diversity and inclusiveness.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">When asked to comment on Morning Consult's polling data, H&M pointed to a previously issued statement that said its commitment to fostering “diversity and inclusiveness is genuine.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Sonya Grier, an American University marketing professor who studies race in the marketplace, said the incident’s backlash could be amplified by the cultural context of the moment, such as the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, as well as recent controversy surrounding President Donald Trump’s remarks about immigrants from African nations.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“The whole context around broader social issues that are suggesting certain people are being treated differently is a lot more clear in society, so these types of issues tend to reverberate more,” Grier said in a phone interview Wednesday.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Grier said negative social media buzz can be revived even after it tapers off, noting that in coverage of the H&M photo, media outlets and social media users referred to what she called “tone-deaf” advertisements in the past, such as a Dove video showing a black woman turning into a white woman.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Charlton McIlwain, a New York University professor of media, culture and communication, said he thinks the H&M incident, like other controversies, will be short lived.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“The backlash that’s being felt and is visible in social media and elsewhere will dissipate in the near future and certainly when it comes to attaching unfavorability sentiments to a brand and actual purchasing and buying,” McIlwain said in a Thursday phone interview.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Crisis management will also cost the company, even if it rides out the public criticism, according to&nbsp;Ira Kalb, a University of Southern California marketing professor who studies branding and image creation.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“The unfortunate thing is a lot of the companies that do these things -- they don’t really realize the financial impact, even if it’s just in the short run,” Kalb said in a Thursday phone interview.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX6OyqK3Toq2eZaaesri%2FjKidZqCdYr%2Bqv8RmmKannpx6o7jAnKJmm5%2BjwLa5xKuqZpmWqbKzecKopqWdo6l6rrvNpJyyZaCdvLW7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marseille-propose-un-logement-aux-personnes-atteintes-de-troubles-mentaux.html><span>←</span><span>Marseille propose un logement aux personnes atteintes de troubles mentaux</span></a>
