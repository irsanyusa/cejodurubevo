At the end of the episode, Alexis Michelle came out on top. The bottom two contestants were Lala Ri and Kandy Muse.</p><p>When it came time to save one of these two queens from elimination, Alexis chose to eliminate LaLa. This was shocking, since Alexis seemed to have promised to save LaLa as a thank-you for saving her from elimination in the previous week’s show.</p><p>On Friday, Alexis took to Twitter to respond to the situation, calling it “an impossible choice.” She admitted, “After sleeping on it I wished I could have done differently. I’m sorry for disappointing you. People make mistakes. I own this one. No edit, just me.”</p><p>The Top 4 contestants for All Stars Season 8 are Alexis, Kandy, Jessica Wild, and Jimbo.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RUPAUL INTERRUPTS ‘DRAG RACE ALL STARS 8’ DRAMA, CONVINCES KAHANNA MONTRESE TO STAY IN THE COMPETITION</a></strong></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>It was an impossible choice, a lose lose situation.

She added, “However, her continuing to tell me over and over and over that she’s going to remember that and she’s going to save me, and for her to do what she did, it was just like, eh, this is why I said, if it walk like a duck, quack like a duck, it must be a pit bull.”</p><p>When asked whether Alexis explicitly told LaLa that she wouldn’t vote for her to be eliminated, LaLa recalled, “In the Werk Room I was like, ‘You’ve got me?’ and she said yes. I knew I was going to be in the bottom … It wasn’t a shocker. I remember saying to [Alexis], ‘You’ve got me,’ and she said yes.”</p><p>LaLa said Alexis texted her, but she hasn’t replied yet, adding, “No, we’re all good. It’s a competition … I love my sisters, I had so much fun, I still feel like a winner. I enjoyed my entire time up until I packed my bags and left. No bad blood — I still love her.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_FrankieJonas_Gizelle-HernandezABC-via-Getty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Frankie Jonas Releases Debut EP ‘Sewer Rat’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rupaul's drag race all stars</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zZ6uZpyilrRuvsCcnGaZnKF6tMDAq6pmnaCewLCwxGacp5yjYsSqwMdmmqimpKe8t7HRrKCapF2auaq5yKeYraGfo3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./0-28804-1913612-1913610-1913599-00-html.html><span>←</span><span>Life Savers Soda - Top 10 Bad Beverage Ideas</span></a>
