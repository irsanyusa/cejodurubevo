It&nbsp;turns out that this iceberg most likely formed out of&nbsp;snow that fell 100,000 years ago! Researchers used computer modeling to&nbsp;figure out its origin.</p><p>They used data from 1912 and added some new information about winds and ocean currents. They concluded that the iceberg was probably a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;small cluster of&nbsp;glaciers in&nbsp;Southwest Greenland.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b7b/859/98d8c55875a2cc969d2c7f3628.png><p>These days, it’s possible to&nbsp;calculate the routes of&nbsp;such icebergs in&nbsp;any given year in&nbsp;the past. So, the infamous chunk of&nbsp;ice was on&nbsp;its way from Greenland to&nbsp;an&nbsp;area further south from Cornwall. If&nbsp;the ship had passed through that region only two days later, the iceberg would have moved far away from the point where they met.</p><p>At&nbsp;first, the weight of&nbsp;the most well-known iceberg in&nbsp;the world was 75&nbsp;million tons. With time, it&nbsp;started to&nbsp;slowly melt away. And when it&nbsp;sank the Titanic, its weight was only 1.5 million tons. By&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;the collision, it’d probably been melting for months. But it&nbsp;was still a&nbsp;true monster&nbsp;— when the Titanic sank, the iceberg was 400 feet long. And more than 100 feet of&nbsp;its surface was above the water.</p><p>Some people believe it&nbsp;was a ’supermoon’ that caused the Titanic to&nbsp;sink. That night, there was a&nbsp;rare lunar event&nbsp;— it&nbsp;hadn’t happened for 1,400&nbsp;years. In&nbsp;normal conditions, the iceberg wouldn’t have traveled so&nbsp;far south without melting and losing the largest part of&nbsp;its mass.</p><p>But the supermoon could have been the reason for an&nbsp;unusually high tide that pulled the iceberg away from the glacier way faster than usual. There’s a&nbsp;specific type of&nbsp;<a href=# title=bacteria data-link=tag>bacteria</a> [Halomonas titanicae] that slowly consumes the remains of&nbsp;the Titanic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0be/f9e/48fb0353d2b37f0811599ab121.png><p>Salt corrosion, ocean currents, freezing temperatures, plus this rust-eating microorganism might consume the entire wreckage! American actress Dorothy Gibson was aboard the Titanic. She survived, and when she arrived in&nbsp;New York City, she started filming a&nbsp;movie called “<strong>Saved From the Titanic</strong>” almost right away.</p><p>The movie was released only a&nbsp;month after the Titanic sank. And in&nbsp;the movie, she even wore the same shoes and clothes she had during the actual disaster. The movie was a&nbsp;big success at&nbsp;that time, but the only known copy was destroyed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fire.</p><p>14&nbsp;years before the Titanic sank, a&nbsp;novella called “<strong>Futility</strong>” had been published. And it&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;have predicted the whole event! The plot centered around a&nbsp;fictional ship called the Titan that sank during its voyage. The Titan was almost the same size as&nbsp;the Titanic, and they both went to&nbsp;the bottom in&nbsp;April. And the reason was hitting an&nbsp;iceberg, too!</p><p>Both the real and fictional ships were described as&nbsp;unsinkable. And both of&nbsp;them had the legally required number of&nbsp;lifeboats, which, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;turned out later, were nowhere near enough. We’ve seen it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the movie, but there were some real-life love stories happening on&nbsp;the Titanic, too.&nbsp;13&nbsp;couples even took a&nbsp;trip on&nbsp;the Titanic as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;their honeymoon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/289/4d6/50ca8d519eb5ab5923c0c7f46e.png><p>One of&nbsp;the couples owned Macy’s department store in&nbsp;New York. Once it&nbsp;became clear the Titanic was rapidly sinking, the woman refused to&nbsp;go&nbsp;into a&nbsp;lifeboat without her husband. But he&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;join her while there were still women and children who he&nbsp;thought had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;first. Then his wife gave her coat to&nbsp;her maid. She insisted that the maid should get into the lifeboat, and she wanted her to&nbsp;be&nbsp;warm. As&nbsp;for the woman herself, she decided to&nbsp;stay with her husband till the end.</p><p>Some people believe the Titanic sank because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mummy, not an&nbsp;iceberg. It&nbsp;all started around 1,000&nbsp;BCE with a&nbsp;mysterious woman who lived in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Egypt data-link=tag>Egypt</a>, in&nbsp;the city of&nbsp;thieves. People knew little about her, but they called her a&nbsp;priestess. Her mummy was put in&nbsp;a&nbsp;wooden sarcophagus and covered with a&nbsp;large lid with the image of&nbsp;her face and some mystical inscriptions.</p><p>This place had been hidden until the first half of&nbsp;the 19th century when a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;locals accidentally came across&nbsp;it. They disturbed her peace. No&nbsp;one knows how, but the mummy disappeared that day without a&nbsp;trace.</p><p>A&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;decades later, a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;rich friends from England traveled to&nbsp;Egypt and found the empty mummy casket with the image of&nbsp;the priestess, whose dark eyes seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;looking into the void. They decided to&nbsp;buy&nbsp;it. But the buyer disappeared the same night before he&nbsp;even got the case. All members of&nbsp;the group had some accidents. The casket changed its location a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;times&nbsp;— until&nbsp;it, as&nbsp;some believe, ended up&nbsp;on&nbsp;the Titanic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/af7/1b6/c3ab1652719923fcef029d9ef7.png><p>It&nbsp;took more than 70&nbsp;years for a&nbsp;robot submarine to&nbsp;find the ruins of&nbsp;this legendary ship. The wreck lies nearly 13,000 feet under the surface of&nbsp;the Atlantic Ocean, split into two halves. Why did the liner break apart? No&nbsp;one knows exactly. Some think it&nbsp;happened because of&nbsp;the water that got inside when the ship collided with the iceberg. The pressure was so&nbsp;powerful it&nbsp;separated two parts of&nbsp;the vessel, starting with the ship’s bottom structure.</p><p>Others say it&nbsp;was because of&nbsp;the hull rivets. They had a&nbsp;high concentration of&nbsp;slag&nbsp;— or&nbsp;smelting residue. And that’s something that can cause the metal to&nbsp;split apart. The ship generally had many flaws, starting with the design. The water-tight bulkheads weren’t completely sealed on&nbsp;top. This allowed the water to&nbsp;flow between the compartments and, in&nbsp;the end, sink the vessel.</p><p>The iron of&nbsp;the ship’s rivets and steel of&nbsp;the hull ended up&nbsp;ruined because of&nbsp;high sulfur content, cold temperatures, and high speeds. The steel shattered, and the rivets popped out quite easily. Because of&nbsp;this, the Titanic sank 24&nbsp;times faster than it&nbsp;would have otherwise. If&nbsp;the ship had hit the iceberg head-on instead of&nbsp;ramming it&nbsp;with its side, it&nbsp;would have probably stayed afloat.</p><p>How come the crew members didn’t have binoculars? It&nbsp;would have surely helped them to&nbsp;spot the iceberg on&nbsp;time and maybe even avoid the disaster. But the binoculars on&nbsp;the Titanic were locked in&nbsp;a&nbsp;storage compartment. Only one crew member had the key. And he&nbsp;had been transferred off the ship right before it&nbsp;set sail. He&nbsp;later said he&nbsp;“hadn’t remembered” to&nbsp;hand over the key. But even without the binoculars, the ship might have had some time to&nbsp;change course and avoid the collision if&nbsp;the crew had gotten some warning. But that’s the thing&nbsp;— someone DID warn them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a5b/625/78217659d6bf2b6585b30ae204.png><p>About an&nbsp;hour before the incident, a&nbsp;ship that was relatively close to&nbsp;the Titanic, the S.S. Californian, sent a&nbsp;message to&nbsp;inform them it&nbsp;had stopped because of&nbsp;“dense field ice.” But the warning never got to&nbsp;the Titanic’s captain.</p><p>Some experts say it&nbsp;was because the radio operator didn’t think it&nbsp;was that urgent. And later, the S.S. Californian said they didn’t get a&nbsp;call for help from the Titanic because their radio operator was off duty.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/fe2/6b1/23c9c259af99823a9a15c5ea4b.png><p>Some say the crew on&nbsp;the Titanic couldn’t spot the iceberg on&nbsp;time because of&nbsp;an&nbsp;optical illusion. Atmospheric conditions that night probably caused super refraction, which could have camouflaged the berg. After all, no&nbsp;one actually saw the iceberg until it&nbsp;was too close to&nbsp;the ship to&nbsp;somehow avoid the crash.</p><p>Not even a&nbsp;whole minute passed between the moment they saw the iceberg and the collision. It&nbsp;was only 37&nbsp;seconds. And it&nbsp;took the Titanic 2&nbsp;hours and 40&nbsp;minutes to&nbsp;disappear below the ocean’s waves.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMCktcSnq6KrpKh6s7HVnpilnZRir6qzxp6qrWWjmrCzsdNmpp9lpJ2ybsDIrZinoZNitqSxwZ6poGVoZoF1gJdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tour-des-terr-retour-vers-la-prehistoire-en-nouvelle-aquitaine.html><span>←</span><span>retour vers la Prhistoire en Nouvelle-Aquitaine</span></a>
