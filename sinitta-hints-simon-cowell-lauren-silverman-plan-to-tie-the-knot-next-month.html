The <a href=#>America’s Got Talent</a> judge recently shut down rumors that his wedding was set for June, but his close friend says otherwise.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sinitta-reveals-that-simon-cowell-lauren-silverman-are-tying-the-knot-in-june>Sinitta Reveals That Simon Cowell, Lauren Silverman Are Tying The Knot in June</h2><p>Cowell’s close friend, pop singer Sinitta, recently revealed that his wedding is set to take place in June. She revealed that she will not be able to attend the wedding due to her prior obligations with the musical, Chicago. The singer is set to appear on stage from June 6 to 11 in Belfast and in June 14 to 18 in Plymouth. Reportedly, she hinted that the couple will tie the knots during the earlier dates.</p><p>She joked that she will still send a gift in place of her attendance. Sinitta said she would send Cowell “the lucky irish leaf” and “a shamrock from Louis (Walsh).”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Cc-TikJK7f_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>Cowell and Sinitta first met in the 1980’s after she was signed to his record company. They began their private on and off again relationship around this time, their romantic relationship ended around the arrival of his son, Eric in 2014. Ever since, the former couple has remained as very close friends.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Is Expected to Attend The Wedding?</h2><p>Since Cowell is known for hating giant parties, it came as no surprise that he is <a href=#>planning</a> this occasion himself. In April, he shared that he is skipping the wedding planner for his special day.</p><p>“I am planning it all, otherwise I know what will happen — there will be 600 people and it’ll get out of control, like my 50th birthday party,” he <a href=#>said</a>. “No one knows when it’s going to be — that’ll be a surprise, even for Lauren.”</p><p>Reportedly, the couple is attempting to keep their ceremony intimate, inviting close friends and family. Since the intimacy of Cowell’s special day was revealed, close sources to his family have confirmed their attendance. Reportedly, Cowell’s half siblings, Michael, Tony, and June are expected to be in attendance, while his full brother <a href=#>Nick</a> will not.</p><p>Britain’s Got Talent judge <a href=#>David Walliams</a> admitted that he has yet to receive an invite to the wedding. He explained that while he hopes to get an invite, he understands their desire for a small gathering.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Cowell popped the question to his girlfriend of nearly 13 years this past December. Ahead of his engagement, the America’s Got Talent judge was notorious for claiming that he would never marry. Reportedly, his opinion on marriage was changed due to his 2020 back injury, as well as the coronavirus pandemic. He expressed that they felt engaged before the ring was ever given. Recently, Cowell shared that he felt marrying Silverman was “the <a href=#>right thing</a> to do” for their son, Eric.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1210477670-scaled.jpg alt="Howie Mandel Opens Up About OCD During Mental Health Awareness Month" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>simon cowell</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKloqyklnqptc2tqmarmaK8r3nCqK6epJxiuaLB0Z6lZquZocOmvsyapWaonJa7bsDOZquinV2ptaZ5yqemrWWemsW1ecyopa2gXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-agt-2024-dance-group-legion-malambo.html><span>←</span><span>Meet 'AGT' 2024 Dance Group Legin Malambo</span></a>
