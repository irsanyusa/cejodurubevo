You move from now to now, crumpling time up in your hands, tossing it away. You're your own speeding car. You think you can get rid of things, and people too—leave them behind. You don't yet know about the habit they have, of coming back - <i>The Blind Assassin</i></li><li>Time is not a thing that passes. It's a sea on which you float. <i>- The Year of the Flood</i></li><li>Another belief of mine: that everyone else my age is an adult, whereas I am merely in disguise. - <i>Cat's Eye</i></li><li>War is what happens when language fails. - <i>The Robber Bride</i></li><li>When you are in the middle of a story it isn’t a story at all, but only confusion. A dark roaring, blindness, a wreckage of shattered glass and splintered wood; like a house in a whirlwind, or else a boat crushed by the icebergs or swept over the rapids, and all aboard powerless to stop it. It’s only afterwards that it becomes anything like a story at all. When you are telling it, to yourself or someone else. -<i> Alias Grace</i></li><li>I would like to be the air that inhabits you for a moment only. I would like to be that unnoticed and that necessary. <i>- Cat's Eye</i></li><li>Why does the mind do such things? Turn on us, rend us, dig the claws in.

Up, on a pedestal or down on your knees, it's all a male fantasy. That you're strong enough to take what they dish out, or else too weak to do anything about it.
