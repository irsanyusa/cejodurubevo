Flowers were in the arms of Lucrezia Bori and everywhere on the front of the stage. Applause was thundering. Miss Bori was bowing. The audience was standing up. Miss Bori tossed one of her bouquets to a woman standing in the second row of the orchestra. The woman caught it gracefully. She, too, bowed. The applause was getting louder and louder.

Apple’s goal of operating a go-to sports streaming hub is no secret. Since 2022, the company has committed to spending hundreds of millions annually on MLB and MLS media rights. Apple’s docuseries on Inter Miami superstar Lionel Messi, which premiered earlier this month, has helped generate buzz for its MLS broadcasts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Diapers are essential—and when parents lack access to them, the whole family suffers. Yet they are exorbitantly expensive, costing between $80 and $100 per month, per baby. For low-income families, who spend around 14% of their income on diapers, they are the fourth-highest expenditure after other essentials like food, rent, and utilities.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Fewer Voters Than Ever See Biden as Mentally Fit</h2><time>Aug 14, 2024</time>
