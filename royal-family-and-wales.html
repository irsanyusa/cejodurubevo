The castle and estate were established using proceeds from the North Wales slate industry and the transatlantic slave trade, as the family owned a number of sugar plantations in Jamaica. For the royal visit in 1859, a&nbsp;one-ton slate bed was commissioned for the Queen and Prince, but Queen Victoria refused to sleep in it because it reminded her of a tomb. The bed can be seen there to this day.</p><p>Years later, Queen Victoria visited <a href=#>Palé Hall</a>, in the Dee Valley near Bala. She was enchanted by it. You can now stay in the room she slept in - aptly called <a href=#>The Victoria Room</a> - complete with the original bath, basin and bed used by Queen Victoria.</p><p><strong>Several kings were born in Wales</strong></p><p>Henry V was born in <a href=#>Monmouth Castle</a> in 1386. He spent much of his youth in Wales, fighting against the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr. Henry Tudor (Harri Tudur in Welsh, and later known as Henry VII) was born at <a href=#>Pembroke Castle</a> in 1457.</p><p><strong>Wales has many hotels with royal links</strong></p><p><a href=#>Plas Dinas Country House</a> in Caernarfon, now a hotel, is the former home of Lord Snowdon and Princess Margaret.</p><p><a href=#>Llangoed Hall Hotel</a> in the Wye Valley has a long history of links to the British Royal Family. Prince Charles makes bi-annual visits and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have also dropped in. The hotel owns a Rolls-Royce given to the Queen Mother on the birth of Queen Elizabeth II.</p><p><a href=#>The Great House in Laleston</a> near Bridgend, now a hotel, is believed to have been a gift from Queen Elizabeth I to her suitor and court favourite Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester. It is also thought to have once been home to Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII.</p><p><strong>Welsh gold seals in the love</strong></p><p>All major royal weddings have been sealed with <a href=#>Welsh gold</a> since the Queen Mother began the tradition on her marriage to King George VI in 1923.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uK3Lnqpnm5%2BifKKuzq6raKqfrq6tecWapKKkqWKur7CMsJilnaM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./manty.html><span>←</span><span>Manty | Offreur Smart city</span></a>
