Police believe they’ve found the body of a missing Arizona Kindergarten teacher who was last seen bailing a man out of jail.
Cathryn Gorospe, who was a teacher at Arrowhead Elementary School in north Glendale, was reported missing by a roommate after leaving Phoenix to bail Charlie Malzahn out of jail in Flagstaff on Friday, Oct. 6, according to Fox 10.
Malzahn later tried to buy items at a mall with Gorospe’s credit and debit cards and was arrested on unrelated charges while he was driving her SUV, according to the report."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
