You might have expected her to give the honor to Cristina Rae, the singer who previously earned Klum’s Golden Buzzer in Season 15.</p><p>Cristina returned to the AGT stage to deliver a powerhouse performance of “Hold My Hand” by Lady Gaga. Afterward, Klum told Cristina that she didn’t think the singer needed anyone to hold her hand this time. Unlike Terry Crews, who hit his Golden Buzzer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a second time for Detroit Youth Choir</a>, Klum saved the honor for another act.</p><p>Later in the show, BGT Series 14 finalist Aidan McCann took the stage. The 13-year-old magician had help from the judges and host for his mind-reading trick. They colored in a drawing of a superhero and chose a name seemingly at random. Aidan then revealed that both he and Crews were wearing outfits that matched their choices.</p><p>“I don’t know how you did it. You are incredible. I love the magic, but really it is you who is the magic. You really are,” Klum told Aidan before hitting the Golden Buzzer to send him straight to the AGT: All-Stars Finals. She then ran on stage and gave him a hug.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MEET KID MAGICIAN AIDAN MCCANN, ‘IRELAND’S GOT TALENT,’ ‘BRITAIN’S GOT TALENT’ STANDOUT</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-power-duo-is-going-to-the-finals>Power Duo Is Going to the Finals</h3><p>It was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">up to the Superfans</a> to determine which of the remaining nine acts should go to the Finals. The Top 3 turned out to be Filipino couple Power Duo, Romanian dancer Darius Mabda, and AGT Season 14 contestants Ndlovu Youth Choir.</p><p>Host Terry Crews announced that Power Duo had earned the Superfans’ vote. The couple previously won Pilipinas Got Talent, where they confessed their love for each other. They later got married and welcomed a baby son. During this week’s episode, they showed off a mesmerizing routine that combined dance, acrobatics, and aerial skills.</p><p>Power Duo is now the first act in the AGT: All-Stars Finals who did not appear on a previous season of America’s Got Talent. They beat well-known AGT acts such as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sacred Riana</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Finley</a>, and Human Fountains.</p><p>Do you agree with this week’s results?
