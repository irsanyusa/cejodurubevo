This week was no different, with six all new costumed performers singing for the first time. But it was the Bee who stole the show!</strong></p><p>Here is the Bee’s first impressive performance and what we know about her now:</p><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCoqQS7rSlY</a></p><h3>Week 2 Clues</h3><p><strong>Strength</strong>: Hard Worker</p><p><a href=#><strong>Pre-Show Clues</strong></a>: Just a shot of two tennis balls. And on <a href=# class=broken_link>The Masked Singer website</a>, a clue that she is “no stranger to competitions.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Epi</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>ode 2 Clues</strong></a>:&nbsp;The Bee says in her long career, she’s flied to soaring heights. Being a worker bee keeps her young! She says, “you can call me Queen Bee but Empress also suits me.” The Bee is looking forward to singing to a new generation. She wants to see if she still has what it takes! Then, the Bee revealed she started singing in the ’50s.</p><p><strong>Episode 2 Song</strong>: “Chandelier” by Sia</p><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtdEjZHKstU</a></p><h3>Week 4 Clues</h3><p><a href=#><strong>Pre-Show Clues</strong></a>: We receive a clue we’ve already gotten before in the video! Two tennis balls. And&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;<a href=# class=broken_link>website</a>&nbsp;says the Bee “uses her Buddah to get zen.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Epi</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>ode 4 Clues</strong></a>:&nbsp;The Bee says the show gives her a challenge because she usually watches faces and that lifts her up. The package shows peaches splashing and honey in the background. She dances 70’s style throughout the video, with two men in suits next to her. She also picks petals off flower on a bed. The Bee has to be willing to “flip the script.” When asked for one more clue, she says “take me to court.”</p><p><strong>Episode 4 Song</strong>: “Locked Out of Heaven” by Bruno Mars</p><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93uzyWXBlD0</a></p><h3>Week 6 Clues</h3><p><a href=#><strong>Pre-Show Clues</strong></a>: The pre-show video showed pots and pans next to the Bee.&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;<a href=# class=broken_link>website</a>&nbsp;says she “loves Southern cooking.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Epi</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>ode 6 Clues</strong></a>:&nbsp;The Bee says she’s been performing for a long time, singing since the 1950’s. She talks about how her mom first gave her an idea to form a group at a birthday party when she was 8 years old. The Bee says “it was always in the cards.” They then got a record contract and her career has been “all peaches and marmalade ever since.” The shot then shows a plate full of waffles. She says singing all these songs makes her feel like “I’m every bee. It’s all in me!” For her physical clue, the Bee brought out bakeware, saying it’s her second favorite thing to do.</p><p><strong>Episode 6 Song</strong>: “Wrecking Ball” by Miley Cyrus</p><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSnLMtJqsbY</a></p><h3>Week 7 Clues</h3><p><strong><a href=#>Episode 7 Clues</a></strong>: The Bee talked about “getting her groove on back then” while people exercised and did synchronized swimming. She name drops a bunch of songs to throw us off, like “New Attitude,” “Superwoman,” “We Don’t Need Another Hero,” and “Giving You the Best That I’ve Got.” Then, the Bee says she’s singing a song by a “very close friend.” She finished her time on stage responding, “Actually I have 10 [Grammys]!”</p><p><strong>Episode 7 Song</strong>: “What’s Love Got to Do With It?” by Tina Turner</p><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abb0-cDORCk</a></p><h3>Semifinals Clues</h3><p><strong><a href=#>Episode 8 Clues</a></strong>: The Bee says that some of the panel is convinced she’s “the queen of the Pips,” but she’s been giving mixed messages. She is seen in a kitchen eating a peach. The Bee then says, “no one makes a peach cobbler quite like mine.” But after all these years, she’s hoping her Grammys voice leads her to the Finals. A train with “SANTA FE” written on it is shown. The Bee closes by mentioning Aretha Franklin is a friend of hers.</p><p><strong>Episode 8 Song</strong>: “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman” by Aretha Franklin</p><h3><strong>Who is the Bee? (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)</strong></h3><p><strong><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Masked-Singer-Spoilers-Bee-GK.jpg alt="Masked Singer Spoilers Bee GK" width=618 height=410 sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></strong></p><p><strong>Gladys Knight (Honorable Mentions: Tina Turner, Chaka Kahn, and Patti LaBelle)</strong></p><p>This one actually had enough hints in it to solve, if you were playing close enough attention! But there honestly wasn’t much to work with. She’s clearly had a long and impressive career from everything the Bee said. Starting to sing in the 1950’s is no small feat, considering that was 60 years ago! That narrows down the options a lot as it is. The tennis balls gave a little hint because Gladys has been open about her <a href=#>love for tennis</a>. It might also explain her “take me to court” line. Next, the first hint on the website that the Bee is “no stranger to competitions” may be alluding to the fact that Gladys was the lead judge on Apollo Live, a singing competition show on BET.</p><p>Everything else was pretty one-directional though, hinting at wanting her voice to reach a new generation. But the biggest giveaway is when the Bee mentioned (in a quick, almost throwaway line) that “Empress” also suits her. Well, Gladys is known as the Empress of Soul! The judges started catching on in Week 4 too. The clues lined up again too. The peaches splashing in the background could be a nod to her famous song “Midnight Train to Georgia.” The Bee talks about wanting to “flip the script” and Gladys has also acted. And the Buddha clip from The Masked Singer‘s website? Well Gladys was once signed to Buddha Records! There are many illusions to her older age as well, but that isn’t news here.</p><p>In Week 6, most of the new clues were around cooking. Gladys Knight has appeared on talk shows before to <a href=#>cook with the host</a>! The other big clue was about her start, when her mom encouraged her to start a group. That group, of course, was the Pips. While the Bee made some allusions to other similar singers, all the clues are pointing to Gladys Knight! Even her friend <a href=#>Patti Labelle thinks it’s her</a>. We’re convinced!</p><h3>Latest Clues Decoded</h3><p>The Bee said she’s singing a song by a “very close friend” when she performed both Tina Turner and Aretha Franklin. They are both friends of Gladys Knight! Her references to peaches and baking allude to Gladys’ love of cooking. The peach, matched with the image of a train, give a nod to her hit song, “Midnight Train to Georgia.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Masked-Singer-Monster.jpg alt="‘The Masked Singer’ Spoilers, Clues & Predictions: Who Is The Monster?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>masked singer</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqqpJ2UYsCqusaeqWavmKR6qr%2BMrZ%2BeZZKasnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kanye-west-rappers-daughter-north-west-appears-in-his-new-video-only-one.html><span>←</span><span>Rapper's daughter, North West appears in his new video, 'Only One'</span></a>
