John Legend and Niall Horan also had fun blocking each other, while Legend found his long-lost twin.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-john-legend-niall-horan-block-each-other-on-the-voice>John Legend, Niall Horan Block Each Other on The Voice</h2><p>Monday’s new episode started with a four-chair turn for an artist named Stee, who performed “Sugar” by Maroon 5. Legend was the first to turn around, using his one block of the season on Horan. Eventually, the other coaches hit their buttons.</p><p>Horan was annoyed that he couldn’t get Stee on his team, but he promised the singer, “I’ll steal you at some point.” The block turned out to be worth it, because Stee chose to join Team Legend. He also shared that his late cousin was a big fan of the coach, saying his music “helped him get through some tough times.”</p><p>Later in the episode, Horan got his revenge on Legend by blocking him for yet another four-chair turn named Rudi. She performed a powerhouse rendition of “You Don’t Own Me” by Lesley Gore. Ultimately, it turned out to be a wasted block, because Rudi chose to join Team Gwen.</p><p>Rudi wasn’t the only four-chair turn who chose Stefani’s team. Chechi Sarai, who stunned with her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">performance of “Lovin’ You” by Minnie Riperton</a>, also picked Team Gwen.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mac Royals also turned four chairs with his performance of “Gravity” by John Mayer. He chose to join Team Reba, sharing that he and his late grandmother used to watch her sitcom together.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE VOICE’ SEASON 24 COACH GIFTS REVEALED</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-legend-meets-his-long-lost-twin-talakai>Legend Meets His Long-Lost Twin, Talakai</h3><p>Before his audition, singer Talakai admitted that people often tell him he looks like John Legend. He shared his story of being raised in foster homes and eventually getting adopted by his friend’s mom. For his Blind Audition, Talakai sang “Stay with Me” by Sam Smith.</p><p>Legend was the first to turn around, followed by McEntire. When the performance was over, Legend said it was like he was “looking at myself,” pointing out that he and Talakai even had similar hairstyles. McEntire admitted she didn’t have a chance, but said she’s “already a huge fan” of the artist. Of course, Talakai chose to join Team Legend.</p><p>Monday’s episode featured another interesting connection between a coach and an artist, as Claudia B. shared that she had waited on Reba when she was working as a restaurant server. She said the coach ordered a salad and tipped well. McEntire was one of three coaches to turn for Claudia’s performance of “Human Nature” by Michael Jackson, but the singer ultimately chose to join Team Legend.</p><p>What did you think of Monday night’s new episode of The Voice?
