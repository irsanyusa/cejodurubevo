It comes after TfL refused to grant Uber a full operating license in September, saying it had to address passenger safety issues."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

But if Uber does get banned, here are some alternatives if you need to hire a car in London:</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Bolt</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Estonian ride-hailing firm launched in London this year.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rides have a £2.50 ($3.20) base fare, and you’re charged £1.25 ($1.60) per mile and £0.15 ($0.20) per minute.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The company boasts that it’s “safe and reliable,” takes less of a commission from drivers than its rivals, and that all its rides are carbon-neutral.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Sign up here.</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Kapten</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The French ride-hailing firm, acquired by German auto-makers Daimler and BMW, launched in London this year.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rides have a £2.50 ($3.50) base fare, and you’re charged £1.50 ($1.90) per mile and £1.15 ($1.47) per minute.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The company says it covers the “congestion charge” drivers pay to operate in central London, saving riders at least £2 ($2.57) for each trip. Kapten also rewards loyal customers with “points,” which can be redeemed for free rides.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Sign up here</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">ViaVan</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The on-demand ride-sharing firm launched in London in April 2018 after start-up Via and Mercedes-Benz Vans joined forces.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Customers can share their rides with others heading in the same direction in a bid to save money and reduce carbon emissions. ViaVan also offers a private ride option when available.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The firm doesn’t have a base rate available on its site — the fares depend on how far customers travel, when they ride, and the number of plus-ones in their party— but customers can view how much the ride will cost before they book.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Sign up here.</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Gett</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Israeli-owned Gett app launched in London in 2011 as a tech-savvy alternative to hailing one of London’s traditional black cabs, which cannot be ordered in advance.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The app has no minimum fares; riders pay the fare shown on the taxi’s meter, either by card or cash to the driver.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gett says the average wait for one of their cabs is three minutes, and boasts that its drivers are the “highest rated” in the capital.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Get the app here.</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Addison Lee</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Addison Lee launched as a private minicab company in 1975, and now offers users a ride-hailing experience similar to newer startups with its own app.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The company boasts it has “the largest fleet in London” and free Wi-Fi and phone charging in all its cars.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The firm doesn’t have a base rate available on its site, but tells you the exact cost of a journey before you book.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Make a booking here.</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Tube</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">More environmentally-friendly than taking a private car, London’s underground metro system is fast and (usually) efficient.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Paper tickets are expensive, so get cheaper rides by buying an Oyster card at a machine, or by using your contactless debit or credit card at the barriers. Rides in the central “zone 1” of the city start from £2.40 ($3.10) and increase slightly the further afield you go.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Find the cost of traveling between two stations here.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZub2Ntg3Z%2Bjq6Znqpdlrm1sdGnmK2hpprAbrjOp5uopl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hayley-erbert-is-hilariously-flexing-her-engagement-ring-on-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Hayley Erbert is Hilariously Flexing Her Engagement Ring on Instagram</span></a>
