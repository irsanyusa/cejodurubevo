Despite the show’s short run, it&nbsp;opened doors for her in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> and fueled her motivation. Acting <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>became</a> an&nbsp;escape for Field from a&nbsp;challenging childhood, leading her to&nbsp;pursue it&nbsp;further at&nbsp;Columbia Pictures.</p><p>She later starred in&nbsp;the sitcom <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Flying Nun</i></a> and honed her acting skills at&nbsp;Actors Studios. Field gained Hollywood’s attention with the film <i>Sybil</i> and achieved critical acclaim with her Academy Award-winning performance in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Norma Rae</i></a>.</p><h2>Sally loves her life the way it&nbsp;is. And she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>doesn’t</a> see herself marrying again.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/52a/a16/8c05cb5c9faa71345dc77235f0.jpg><p>Field’s passion for acting began in&nbsp;<a href=# title="high school" data-link=tag>high school</a>, and she went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;successful career, despite facing two divorces. She initially married her high school sweetheart and later had a&nbsp;relationship with Burt Reynolds.</p><p>Field then remarried and had a&nbsp;son before ultimately <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>focusing</a> on&nbsp;her career and enjoying her single life. She received an&nbsp;Oscar nomination for her role in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Lincoln</i></a><i> </i>and continued to&nbsp;secure various&nbsp;TV and film roles. Field is&nbsp;content with her life as&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;and has no&nbsp;plans for marriage in&nbsp;the future.</p><p><h2>At&nbsp;76, she decided to&nbsp;age naturally.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/44e/79f/e3cf2e515eabf454d6025f2d13.jpeg><p>After gaining fame as&nbsp;a&nbsp;young actress, Field took a&nbsp;grounded approach to&nbsp;aging gracefully. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;2016&nbsp;interview, she openly embraced the process, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stating</a>, “<strong>I’m an&nbsp;old woman.&nbsp;70&nbsp;is old, and that’s OK</strong>.” While there are aspects she may not love about growing older, such as&nbsp;her neck, she has come to&nbsp;accept&nbsp;it.</p><p>Field took pride in&nbsp;choosing to&nbsp;age naturally and expressed her admiration for women who resisted plastic surgery. She realized the importance of&nbsp;respecting and appreciating one’s present self, rather than striving for an&nbsp;idealized image from the past. <strong>“I&nbsp;see myself on&nbsp;TV, and I&nbsp;say, ’Oh, I&nbsp;wish that weren’t happening to&nbsp;my&nbsp;neck.’ And your face is&nbsp;falling down, and your eyes are so&nbsp;puffy,” </strong>Field <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>.</p><p><h2>She was criticized for her choice.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b9e/50a/51070d535ca1146cd20e20e66c.jpg><p>Andy Kropa/Invision/East News</p><p>Field was diagnosed with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>osteoporosis</a>, a&nbsp;“silent disease,” before turning 60&nbsp;in&nbsp;2005. She acknowledged fitting the risk profile due to&nbsp;her small build, age, and ethnicity. The condition weakens bones, increasing the risk of&nbsp;fractures in&nbsp;the hip, wrist, and spine.</p><p>Women are more susceptible to&nbsp;osteoporosis due to&nbsp;hormonal changes during menopause, which lead to&nbsp;decreased bone density. Despite Field’s efforts to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>maintain</a> a&nbsp;healthy lifestyle with proper nutrition, exercise, and calcium intake, she couldn’t prevent the diagnosis, emphasizing the unpredictable nature of&nbsp;the disease.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite her natural aging and health challenges, Field faced criticism for her appearance. In&nbsp;2018, social media trolls targeted her on&nbsp;Twitter, making hurtful comments about her looks. Some individuals resorted to&nbsp;insults, calling her “ugly” and making derogatory remarks about her physical features. Such comments are disrespectful and reflect the negative side of&nbsp;online interactions.</p><p>Field’s journey inspires those who choose <a href=#>to&nbsp;age naturally</a>, embracing the passage of&nbsp;time with grace and resilience. This choice empowers individuals and encourages a&nbsp;positive shift in&nbsp;societal norms. By&nbsp;embracing natural aging, they inspire others to&nbsp;embrace their own beauty, fostering a&nbsp;culture of&nbsp;self-acceptance and genuine confidence.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMCiuMuyZJ%2BhlaGxboOVZq6aq12Yrq24xJ1krp%2BcrnqistOeqWaclZi2pbXNoGStp12WtKZ5zZqrrqqRobm6ecGuq2avlWLBqbXNpGSqrZmpsm7Ax55kqKigpMCqwMRmb2praGqDcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./avengers-character-posters.html><span>←</span><span>Photos: 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' Character Posters</span></a>
