This is&nbsp;exactly what went through <a href=# title="Salma Hayek" data-link=tag>Salma Hayek</a>’s mind when she met Penélope Cruz in&nbsp;her early <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> days.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;love stories that seem like a&nbsp;movie but happen in&nbsp;real life. That’s why we’re telling you how lucky Hayek and Cruz were to&nbsp;meet each other.</p><p>We&nbsp;have to&nbsp;travel back to&nbsp;the 1990s, when actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Salma Hayek</a> was just beginning her acting <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> in&nbsp;the United States. She was already famous in&nbsp;Mexico, her native country, but getting to&nbsp;Hollywood at&nbsp;that time with a&nbsp;Latin accent was not easy.</p><p>On&nbsp;the other hand, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Penélope Cruz</a> became an&nbsp;upcoming “it&nbsp;girl” thanks to&nbsp;her roles in&nbsp;several Spanish television series. After lots of&nbsp;patience and work, she had finally managed to&nbsp;land a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;Hollywood, so&nbsp;she decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;US for 2&nbsp;months to&nbsp;prepare for&nbsp;it. And although she didn’t know anyone, she was determined to&nbsp;carve a&nbsp;path for herself in&nbsp;Hollywood.</p><p>Fortunately, Penélope Cruz met Salma Hayek, although they had only spoken on&nbsp;the phone. When Hayek heard that Cruz was going to&nbsp;Los Angeles, she decided to&nbsp;help her without thinking twice. The Mexican actress understood very well how difficult and lonely it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;to&nbsp;make your way on&nbsp;the Hollywood big screen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b87/45c/fcbf4f5e9e88ae3f86cc7234f2.jpg><p>Cruz arrived in&nbsp;Los Angeles with the idea of&nbsp;staying in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hotel, but Hayek offered not only to&nbsp;pick her up&nbsp;at&nbsp;the airport, but she also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>told</a> her, “You’re not going to&nbsp;the hotel. You’re coming to&nbsp;my&nbsp;house because this is&nbsp;hard at&nbsp;the beginning, and you’re going to&nbsp;feel very lonely.” Once she was at&nbsp;Hayek’s house, Cruz was so&nbsp;scared that she said that in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the night she grabbed Hayek’s hand because she was afraid.</p><p>That’s how these actresses <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>met</a>. They have supported each other ever since. Despite the passing of&nbsp;the decades and their busy schedules and personal lives, their feelings for each other have not changed. In&nbsp;fact, they’ve considered each other sisters ever since.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fa5/5d5/190ddd5024be17ea2e2cf7a49a.jpg><p>Cruz made it&nbsp;clear what a&nbsp;good friend Hayek was and&nbsp;is. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “She told&nbsp;me, ’Whether you want to&nbsp;or&nbsp;not, you don’t know&nbsp;me, but you’re coming to&nbsp;my&nbsp;house, I’m not going to&nbsp;leave you alone.’ I&nbsp;love her so&nbsp;much, from day one she has been like that with&nbsp;me.” The actress continued, “It&nbsp;was amazing, you know, that somebody that&nbsp;I didn’t know&nbsp;— only on&nbsp;the phone&nbsp;— she made sure that she picked me&nbsp;up&nbsp;at&nbsp;the airport, and she didn’t let me&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the hotel.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ab6/34e/54056655e4bce61d2151cbb397.jpg><p>Since the very beginning of&nbsp;their careers, they’ve managed to&nbsp;work together on&nbsp;just one production, the 2006&nbsp;film, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Bandidas</i></a>, which was not very successful, but it&nbsp;did give them the satisfaction of&nbsp;working alongside one another.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the things that proved to&nbsp;Cruz that Hayek was truly a&nbsp;great friend was when, during the 2007 Oscar nominees <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announcement</a> ceremony, she mentioned Cruz in&nbsp;a&nbsp;nomination and could not help but make a&nbsp;gesture of&nbsp;joy in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;everyone because of&nbsp;how proud she felt.</p><p>It’s impossible to&nbsp;deny the special affection that exists between these women. We’re practically demanding for producers in&nbsp;Hollywood to&nbsp;give them a&nbsp;second chance to&nbsp;appear together on&nbsp;the screen. Will they comply?</p><p>How do&nbsp;you feel about long-term, unconditional relationships? What is&nbsp;the kindest thing you have ever done for a&nbsp;stranger?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLauec2oq2afn567qHnTqGSlnZGrsm7Fzq5kmqSfo7JurYysq6iqqWK8p3nHqK5mq5GhuqJ5x5qwnqNdlrulec%2BepZ6kn6Wybq%2FRrrFmmpWYrq6xjJ%2Bpop2emcBuss6rZKWhlpp6eXyVcm1vZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1336017-how-port-number-google-voice-html.html><span>←</span><span>How to port number to Google Voice and why should you do it?</span></a>
