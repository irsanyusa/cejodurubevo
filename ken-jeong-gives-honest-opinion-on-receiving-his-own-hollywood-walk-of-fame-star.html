Jeong reflected on his unlikely career journey from physician to celebrated actor and comedian.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ken-jeong-still-processing-prestigious-honor>Ken Jeong Still Processing Prestigious Honor</h2><p>When asked by The Talk hosts about receiving a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> star, Jeong admitted he is still processing the prestigious honor. He never imagined such recognition when starting out as a doctor at Kaiser Permanente years ago.</p><p>Jeong expressed feeling humbled, believing there are many more deserving performers. However, he is deeply grateful for the fans’ love and goodwill behind this achievement. Co-host Natalie Morales joked Jeong is still a doctor since laughter is the best medicine. Jeong quipped his ego and lost 30 pounds thanks to the validating accomplishment.</p><p>Despite his fame, Jeong remains humble and grounded as a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">physician</a>. Jeong practiced medicine full-time until the mid-2000s. His initial goal was to transition to acting and hopefully become a working character actor.</p><p>Jeong just wanted to find regular entertainment industry work, without expectations of stardom. He hoped to make a consistent living as a comedic performer. The public embraced Jeong through hits like The Hangover movies and TV’s Community. He rapidly went from unknown to a household name.</p><p>While processing this honor, Jeong credited supportive fans for getting him there. He feels the recognition reflects the public’s goodwill.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ken-jeong-on-playful-banter-with-natalie-morales-on-hosting-i-can-see-your-voice>Ken Jeong on Playful Banter With Natalie Morales on Hosting I Can See Your Voice</h2><p>During his same guest appearance on The Talk, Jeong engaged in funny banter with co-host Morales about his hosting gig on I Can See Your Voice. Morales jokingly called out Jeong for being a terrible guesser on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Masked Singer</a>, saying it must be a relief to now host I Can See Your Voice instead.</p><p>Playing along, Jeong reacted with mock outrage to Morales’ “hard-hitting journalism” and teasing. He quipped that her “scoop” about his poor guessing skills was nothing new. The two then threatened a comedic “fake beep off,” with Morales vowing to “come after” Jeong.</p><p>I Can See Your Voice premiered its third season on January 4, with Jeong as host and executive producer. The music guessing series was a ratings hit when it debuted in 2020.</p><p>Jeong is joined by Cheryl Hines and Adrienne Bailon-Houghton as panelists. Rotating guest celebrities also assist the contestant attempting to weed out bad “Secret Voices.”</p><p>With $100,000 on the line each episode, the contestant ultimately picks one singer to perform with the musical superstar guest. This results either in amazing chemistry or hilarious failure.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_KatyPerry_OrlandoBloom_Michael-KovacGetty-Images-for-Lifetime-220x153.jpg alt="Are Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom Married?
