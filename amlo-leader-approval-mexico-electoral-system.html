It also recruits ordinary citizens to manage individual polling places as a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>civic responsibility</a>, similar to jury service in the United States.

It was a demonstration of how important Mexicans believe this institution is for our own democracy.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But the real value of such a public demonstration against the president may have been to show members of the opposition that their own voters would not tolerate cooperation with the administration on this issue. Morning Consult trend data shows López Obrador hovering around a 42% approval rating among PRI voters, for example, which has been enough to make some lawmakers see the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>value of cooperation</a> in the past.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“This demonstration sent a very clear message to the other parties of the risks they would run if they vote in favor of this reform, as they did, for example, when the PRI voted with AMLO in favor of the militarization of public works and other aspects of civil society,” Campero said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZMGzsc2dZKydpKmys7%2BOmqSlp12hsqKwxKtkmqigp7y3rctmpJ6wmZi8brHLnpqtp6KWuW6%2F2KyrnqU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shawn-mendes-self-titled-album-why-why-why-isnt-that-enough-1236081984.html><span>←</span><span>Shawn Mendes Announces Self-Titled New Album Plus Singles Why Why Why and Isnt Tha</span></a>
