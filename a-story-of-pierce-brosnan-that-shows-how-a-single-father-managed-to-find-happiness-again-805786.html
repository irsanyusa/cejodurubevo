His parents separated when he&nbsp;was still a&nbsp;baby and he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>grew up</a>&nbsp;with his maternal grandparents while his mother worked in&nbsp;London as&nbsp;a&nbsp;nurse. When he&nbsp;was 6&nbsp;years old, his grandparents passed away, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;lived with different relatives until, at&nbsp;10, his mother was able to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;him.</p><p>His mother was very <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>supportive</a> of&nbsp;his dream to&nbsp;become an&nbsp;actor. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;young man growing up&nbsp;in&nbsp;Ireland, he&nbsp;loved western movies and cowboys. He&nbsp;joined the Oval House Theatre to&nbsp;get his acting education, and in&nbsp;1975, he&nbsp;started working as&nbsp;an&nbsp;assistant stage manager.</p><p><h2>His first great love</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0a9/914/a7ac6c522da2ae0c2b808f95c6.jpg><p>He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>debuted</a> as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor in&nbsp;1980 in&nbsp;the film, <i>The Long Good Friday</i>. That same year, he&nbsp;married his ex-wife, Australian actress, Cassandra Harris, better known as&nbsp;Sandra Colleen Waites. She was 11&nbsp;years older than him, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>began</a> her career in&nbsp;1977, and had 2&nbsp;children at&nbsp;the time she met Brosnan.</p><p><h2>Cassandra and Pierce’s love story</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7c7/9bb/c57f8b548c8818a2173a397033.jpg><p>They met in&nbsp;1974 thanks to&nbsp;her nephew, who was a&nbsp;classmate of&nbsp;Pierce’s at&nbsp;the drama school where he&nbsp;trained. On&nbsp;one occasion, he&nbsp;accompanied him to&nbsp;his aunt’s house, and when he&nbsp;saw her picture he&nbsp;said, “This is&nbsp;your aunt? My&nbsp;God, what a&nbsp;beautiful woman.”</p><p>Their first in-person meeting was a&nbsp;few days later, and his admiration was confirmed, “I&nbsp;saw her coming down the stairs and thought, ’What a&nbsp;beautiful woman.’ Not for an&nbsp;instant did&nbsp;I think she was someone&nbsp;I would spend 17&nbsp;years of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life with. I&nbsp;didn’t think about courting her or&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;court her. I&nbsp;just wanted to&nbsp;enjoy her beauty and who she was.”</p><p><h2>The blended family he&nbsp;loved</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/036/48b/f2d942564d8bc92dbada0a9ba0.jpg><p>But mutual attraction led them to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;couple and later, a&nbsp;family. Although he&nbsp;was only 23&nbsp;at the time when they married, he&nbsp;adopted Cassandra’s children, Charlotte and Christopher, who soon adjusted to&nbsp;their new father, and he&nbsp;didn’t take long to&nbsp;love them as&nbsp;his own: “I&nbsp;didn’t feel like a&nbsp;father, I&nbsp;wasn’t a&nbsp;father. I&nbsp;was just Pierce. And then&nbsp;I became Dad Pierce. And then Dad,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>.</p><p>“When I&nbsp;get home from the studio or&nbsp;set, work stays there and life revolves around the kitchen table and what’s going on&nbsp;in&nbsp;our kids’ lives: soccer, homework, planning the next adventure. I&nbsp;get to&nbsp;go&nbsp;home to&nbsp;the most beautiful wife on&nbsp;the planet, lovely kids, a&nbsp;nice normal life, and then&nbsp;I get to&nbsp;run off and play at&nbsp;the movies, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fantasy world,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a> about his fatherhood.</p><p>Later, the couple had their only child together, Sean Brosnan, who also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>followed</a> in&nbsp;his parents’ footsteps in&nbsp;acting.</p><p><h2>The hardest moment of&nbsp;his life</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/057/9ca/aeffb95cd09a594a97896b3b99.jpg><p>But even the most beautiful stories sometimes have sad moments. For Pierce, that happened in&nbsp;1991, when Cassandra passed away from ovarian cancer. Years later, in&nbsp;2013, her daughter, Charlotte, also lost her life to&nbsp;the same disease: “I&nbsp;don’t see the cup half full, believe&nbsp;me [...]. The brooding, Irish black dog sits next to&nbsp;me&nbsp;from time to&nbsp;time,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>, regarding his tragic loss.</p><p>“She has made me&nbsp;the man I&nbsp;am, the actor I&nbsp;am, the father I&nbsp;am. She will forever be&nbsp;embedded in&nbsp;every fiber of&nbsp;my&nbsp;being. She is&nbsp;with me&nbsp;every day. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;blessing to&nbsp;have met someone like that,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>acknowledged</a> in&nbsp;memory of&nbsp;his beloved. But the passing of&nbsp;his wife did not stop him and he&nbsp;carried on&nbsp;for his children, whom he&nbsp;raised and cared for as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single parent.</p><p><h2>Life gave him a&nbsp;rematch, and so&nbsp;he&nbsp;started over.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e96/0db/a441fa5d7e9585914f09e6a27f.jpg><p>But love knocked on&nbsp;his door again, and the family picture was complete when he&nbsp;met <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>journalist</a> Keely Shaye at&nbsp;a&nbsp;party in&nbsp;Mexico on&nbsp;April&nbsp;8, 1994. “We&nbsp;sat under the stars and he&nbsp;held my&nbsp;hand. There were fireworks over our heads and Kenny Loggins was singing. We&nbsp;talked until 3&nbsp;a.m.,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recounted</a> of&nbsp;their first date, and he&nbsp;added, “I&nbsp;found a&nbsp;great woman in&nbsp;Keely Shaye.” He&nbsp;continued, “Wherever in&nbsp;the world&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;travel, I&nbsp;missed her and sent her tickets to&nbsp;go&nbsp;so&nbsp;we&nbsp;could be&nbsp;together. We&nbsp;just seemed to&nbsp;click.”</p><p>They had two children, Dylan, born in&nbsp;1997, and Paris, who was born in&nbsp;2001. They decided to&nbsp;say, “I&nbsp;do,” on&nbsp;August&nbsp;4, 2001. Since then, their love has only grown stronger over the years.</p><p><h2>The driving force of&nbsp;his life: his family</h2></p><p>Currently, they have been married for 21&nbsp;years and are one of&nbsp;the most stable couples in&nbsp;Hollywood. On&nbsp;Instagram, they never miss the opportunity to&nbsp;share the moments they live together and acknowledge their anniversaries: “Thank you for bringing so&nbsp;much love and beauty into my&nbsp;life, for making these last 26&nbsp;years the greatest joy of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, expressing his love.</p><p>Pierce’s story is&nbsp;a&nbsp;true reflection of&nbsp;the fact that after the storm, the sun always rises, and affection for one’s children and partner is&nbsp;a&nbsp;feeling that will never be&nbsp;broken.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ba/032/c1a5e054919ba3210dfad8565e.jpg><p>What is&nbsp;the most beautiful love story you know?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uv9OoqbJln5t6sbXEq5qeZZKnvLS6wKdkraCRqXq0tM6wqmagn6x6onnSoqWgpJVis6LAx56pZqWRo66oscNmq6hllp67pXnHmqepoZ6awLR5wKCYoqZdbX12g5dvZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cold-weather-health-risks-winter.html><span>←</span><span>What Lower Temperatures and Cold Weather Does to Your Health</span></a>
