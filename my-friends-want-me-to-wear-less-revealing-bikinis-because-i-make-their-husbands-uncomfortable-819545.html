Find new ones who aren’t judgemental & rude.</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to&nbsp;us! We&nbsp;understand how frustrating this situation&nbsp;is, and we’re here to&nbsp;help you.</p><p><h2>Reconsider your friendship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d72/5a1/0908cb518b8b91223167ca7244.jpg><p>See if&nbsp;this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;one-time incident or&nbsp;a&nbsp;pattern that makes you feel bad about your body or&nbsp;choices. Do&nbsp;they respect your boundaries and opinions, even if&nbsp;they differ from theirs? If&nbsp;the answer is&nbsp;“no,” then <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>re-evaluating</a> the friendship might be&nbsp;the healthiest option in&nbsp;the long run. Don’t feel obligated to&nbsp;keep the friendship if&nbsp;it&nbsp;makes you feel only worse.</p><p><h2>Find someone else to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the beach with.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8b4/48c/a1a0d5514ebae61c1893d2132c.jpg><p>Try <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expanding</a> your social circle. Look for friends who share your confidence and love for rocking a&nbsp;bikini. Reconnect with someone who shares your love for the beach and body positivity. Alternatively, you can look for local groups or&nbsp;pages dedicated to&nbsp;beach activities and connect with people planning beach outings.</p><p><h2>Don’t take the blame.</h2></p><p>This situation wasn’t your fault. You wore what you felt comfortable and confident&nbsp;in. Instead of&nbsp;saying things like, “Maybe I&nbsp;shouldn’t have worn a&nbsp;bikini,” focus on&nbsp;their inappropriate behavior. Remember, don’t let this experience dim your shine! Keep rocking your favorite swimsuits and don’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>apologize</a> for your self-expression.</p><p><h2>Talk to&nbsp;them.</h2></p><p>Talking in&nbsp;the heat of&nbsp;the moment might not be&nbsp;productive. Avoid bringing it&nbsp;up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;group setting, especially if&nbsp;the husbands are involved. Once you’re both calm, propose grabbing coffee or&nbsp;going for a&nbsp;walk. This casual setting can be&nbsp;less intimidating than a&nbsp;formal sit-down conversation. By&nbsp;<a href=# title=communicating data-link=tag>communicating</a> openly and honestly, you might be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>save</a> the friendship.</p><p>Not all heroes wear capes. Sometimes, they wear swimsuits and arrive just in&nbsp;the nick of&nbsp;time. This was exactly the case for <a href=#>one of&nbsp;our readers</a>. Exhausted from a&nbsp;long day at&nbsp;work, she pulled into the driveway, looking forward to&nbsp;a&nbsp;relaxing evening with her 3-year-old. Instead, her blood ran cold at&nbsp;the sight that greeted her&nbsp;— her daughter was alone in&nbsp;the swimming pool.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecWroJ6mlKh6uK3NrWSmnV2pvG7DxJqpZqSVqMBuvsSvnJqkmaO0bq7IpKCnoaNir6avwK6qnmWZYrqit8Rmq6Gdmad6qcHSm5innKNiwq%2BvzqadqKqklq%2BtsYxxaHJtZGp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./les-eoliennes-tuent-plus-doiseaux-pres-des-zones-protegees.html><span>←</span><span>Les oliennes tuent plus d'oiseaux prs des zones protges</span></a>
