If&nbsp;you throw a&nbsp;rock into the water, it’ll travel 36,000 feet [(11,000&nbsp;M)] before touching the bottom. But unlike your body, the rock won’t experience any unpleasant consequences.</p><p>After all, it&nbsp;doesn’t get affected by&nbsp;all that immense pressure that builds up&nbsp;the deeper you&nbsp;go! But then, what would happen to&nbsp;your body at&nbsp;the very bottom of&nbsp;the Mariana Trench? Put on&nbsp;your flippers, it’s time to&nbsp;dive. Hold your breath!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/824/c7f/57dac559baa86b94f86e68f1d1.png><p>You’re 5&nbsp;feet [(1.5M)] below the surface, and it’s still pretty comfortable down there. You’re used to&nbsp;this depth: you go&nbsp;that deep while diving in&nbsp;the pool. Or&nbsp;maybe at&nbsp;the beach, when watching exotic fish swimming near the bottom.</p><p>But you’re serious about reaching the deepest point of&nbsp;the Mariana Trench&nbsp;— the Challenger Deep. So, you keep going.</p><p>Thirty two feet [32&nbsp;FT (10&nbsp;M)]&nbsp;— that’s where you start to&nbsp;feel some discomfort. Here, the pressure pushing down on&nbsp;your body has doubled [x2&nbsp;pressure]. Your ears and lungs feel a&nbsp;little sore. This is&nbsp;because people have many “air pockets” in&nbsp;their bodies.</p><p>And under pressure, these pockets shrink in&nbsp;volume, and you can feel&nbsp;it. But don’t worry. Your organs aren’t made of&nbsp;metal. They’re flexible enough to&nbsp;withstand even more pressure than that. What you SHOULD worry about at&nbsp;this depth is&nbsp;the white shark. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;wants you for dinner, you’re in&nbsp;worse trouble than high pressure. That’s why you’d better keep diving!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/663/2e3/3087a25ac59f50c7be7b78ecfc.png><p>Around 65&nbsp;feet [20&nbsp;M] underwater. That’s where you’ll need a&nbsp;flashlight and air tanks as&nbsp;you’re running out of&nbsp;breath. The sun’s rays barely reach here, and it’s pretty dark. For the same reason, you’re getting cold. How about putting on&nbsp;a&nbsp;thermal suit, which is&nbsp;what divers usually wear?</p><p>Ah, it’s better now. But even though you feel warmer, your ears are starting to&nbsp;hurt&nbsp;— a&nbsp;lot. And your lungs have shrunk almost three times their normal size. This can be&nbsp;risky for an&nbsp;untrained diver.</p><p>But you’re brave enough&nbsp;— and now, you’re already at&nbsp;a&nbsp;depth of&nbsp;100&nbsp;ft [(30&nbsp;M)]. Only professional divers go&nbsp;that deep without special equipment! The pressure here is&nbsp;three times higher than what you experience on&nbsp;the surface.</p><p>Something weird starts happening to&nbsp;your body. It’s not like anything you’ve ever felt before. And the reason&nbsp;is... your air tank! The compressed air inside is&nbsp;mostly nitrogen (78%) and <a href=# title=oxygen data-link=tag>oxygen</a> (around 21%). But that deep down, nitrogen becomes kinda toxic... It&nbsp;can make you do&nbsp;strange things. Like, you may forget you’re underwater and pull off your oxygen mask.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/686/c60/3272b15b66b0874b709e687f76.png><p>But if&nbsp;you take tanks with more oxygen in&nbsp;them, the dizziness and other strange sensations will pass.&nbsp;200 feet [(60&nbsp;M)] below the surface. The pressure here is&nbsp;7&nbsp;times higher than on&nbsp;dry land. Now, even the oxygen becomes unsafe to&nbsp;you. You have to&nbsp;breathe some gas with [oxygen; nitrogen] helium in&nbsp;it.</p><p>A&nbsp;sharp drop to&nbsp;a&nbsp;depth of&nbsp;700 feet [(214&nbsp;M)]. This mark is&nbsp;the world record in&nbsp;free diving. Herbert Nitsch once managed to&nbsp;reach that deep without any special equipment or&nbsp;air tanks. After that, he&nbsp;received the title of&nbsp;“the deepest man on&nbsp;Earth”. In&nbsp;2012, he&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;break his own record and plunged to&nbsp;a&nbsp;depth of&nbsp;830&nbsp;feet. But it&nbsp;didn’t end well for his health.</p><p>Anyway, if&nbsp;you’d trained to&nbsp;hold your breath for that long, you would probably have very few problems now. That deep down, you need to&nbsp;start looking around again because there can be&nbsp;heavy traffic! Submarines travel at&nbsp;this depth, and you sure don’t want to&nbsp;collide with one of&nbsp;them.</p><p>A&nbsp;few more feet deeper, and you’ve reached the limits of&nbsp;the average human’s body. At&nbsp;the same time, laboratory experiments have proven that people can withstand even higher pressure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/764/ee8/316cbf5ff684098680c0119259.png><p>It&nbsp;went like this: a&nbsp;diver entered a&nbsp;special<strong> </strong>chamber the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;room. Scientists simulated high pressure, comparable to&nbsp;a&nbsp;deep dive, inside this chamber. This way, the researchers discovered that a&nbsp;trained person can withstand the pressure similar to&nbsp;that at&nbsp;a&nbsp;depth of&nbsp;1,600 feet [(500M) depth]!</p><p>But the diver couldn’t just walk out of&nbsp;the chamber after the experiment was over. At&nbsp;high pressure, nitrogen, helium, and other gases build up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the body. And if&nbsp;you normalize the pressure at&nbsp;once, those gases form into bubbles. The consequences are extremely unpleasant, to&nbsp;say the least.</p><p>So&nbsp;you have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;gradual ascent from this depth. This way, the gases can leave your body in&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural way [80% gases]. Sometimes a&nbsp;dive takes a&nbsp;few minutes, but coming to&nbsp;the surface stretches for many hours. It’s all about safety!</p><p>Okay, now, you have to&nbsp;put on&nbsp;a&nbsp;special suit&nbsp;— otherwise, you won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;dive any deeper. It&nbsp;can protect you at&nbsp;a&nbsp;depth of&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;2,300 feet [(700m)]. The suit’s sealed, and the pressure inside is&nbsp;exactly the same as&nbsp;on&nbsp;the surface.</p><p>But all too soon, the suit’s protection isn’t enough anymore. You need a&nbsp;new means to&nbsp;continue your descend. And that’s the Triton 6600&nbsp;submarine. Now that you’re sitting inside a&nbsp;large iron machine, you feel as&nbsp;if&nbsp;you’re driving a&nbsp;car. Only this “vehicle” is&nbsp;worth $5.5&nbsp;million. You certainly don’t want to&nbsp;smash it&nbsp;— so, be&nbsp;careful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/512/96c/9fa0835a0c95a14fa4a85efd47.png><p>You’ve reached a&nbsp;depth of&nbsp;6,600 feet [(2,010m)]. Don’t even think about getting out of&nbsp;the submarine! The pressure here is&nbsp;200 times greater than on&nbsp;the surface! Your body just won’t survive this experience.</p><p>There’s still almost 30,000 feet [9,150m] to&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;the Mariana Trench. If&nbsp;you teleported right there, a&nbsp;huge column of&nbsp;water nearly 7&nbsp;miles high would press down on&nbsp;you with all its force [7&nbsp;mi (11km)]. Your sightseeing tour would be&nbsp;over before it&nbsp;began. Even pressurized submarines can’t withstand that kind of&nbsp;force. Large metal machines just bursts like air balloons.</p><p>At&nbsp;the moment, people only explore the bottom of&nbsp;the Mariana Trench with the help of&nbsp;robots and drones. One of&nbsp;such machines is&nbsp;Nereus. This is&nbsp;an&nbsp;autonomous underwater vehicle that was built specifically for deep-sea diving. It&nbsp;can withstand pressures 1,000 times greater than those on&nbsp;the surface and reach a&nbsp;depth of&nbsp;nearly 36,000 feet [(11,000&nbsp;m)].</p><p>In&nbsp;May 2009, Nereus got to&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;the Challenger Deep&nbsp;— the deepest known point on&nbsp;our planet. Thanks to&nbsp;this machine and its two cameras, people could watch what was going on&nbsp;at&nbsp;that enormous depth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b50/7a8/d923075d2b8175f64a854e9df8.png><p>But people have also set foot in&nbsp;the Challenger Deep. Back in&nbsp;1960, the Trieste bathyscaphe descended to&nbsp;its bottom. The vessel was carrying two crew members. Unfortunately, they couldn’t see their surroundings well&nbsp;— there was only one small window in&nbsp;the bathyscaphe.</p><p>It&nbsp;helped the structure of&nbsp;the ship remain strong. Plus, to&nbsp;withstand the incredible pressure, the iron walls of&nbsp;the bathyscaphe were 5&nbsp;inches thick [5&nbsp;in (≈13&nbsp;cm)].</p><p>But when the explorers reached the ocean floor in&nbsp;the Challenger Deep, one of&nbsp;the window’s panes did crack. Luckily, the ship was still able to&nbsp;spend about 20&nbsp;minutes at&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;the ocean and then rise to&nbsp;the surface.</p><p>But there are living creatures that are used to&nbsp;such incredible conditions. The Mariana snailfish, for example, lives at&nbsp;a&nbsp;depth of&nbsp;24,000 feet [(≈7,300m)]!</p><p>Even the bottom of&nbsp;the Mariana Trench is&nbsp;inhabited! Bacteria and viruses live there. They’re used to&nbsp;low temperatures and high pressure. And their food is&nbsp;all kinds of&nbsp;organic matter that sinks to&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;the ocean.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0ca/07e/4486055c39b7066b56e8a79296.png><p>People can also survive in&nbsp;other extreme conditions&nbsp;— for example, in&nbsp;space. It’s a&nbsp;vacuum. Unlike what many people believe, it’s not cold. It’s also not as&nbsp;dense as&nbsp;air or&nbsp;water. That’s why you’d lose your body heat very slowly.</p><p>But you can do&nbsp;an&nbsp;experiment. Normally, water boils at&nbsp;212˚ F. Let’s say you place a&nbsp;glass of&nbsp;water in&nbsp;a&nbsp;special chamber and gradually lower the pressure. The lower it&nbsp;is, the lower temperature the water needs to&nbsp;boil.</p><p>You’re 70% water. And since space is&nbsp;an&nbsp;almost absolute vacuum, the pressure there is&nbsp;extremely low&nbsp;— near zero! And now, think about what can happen with your very liquid blood&nbsp;— I&nbsp;believe you can imagine the consequences.</p><p>Also, your internal organs would begin to&nbsp;expand. But that’s not a&nbsp;problem&nbsp;— your tissues are flexible and can withstand such an&nbsp;experience.</p><p>The main issue would be&nbsp;the lack of&nbsp;oxygen. Without air, you’d soon lose consciousness. And still, if&nbsp;the rescue team could get to&nbsp;you within 1-2&nbsp;minutes, you’d be&nbsp;fine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/eae/df1/2ebf14589ca4228db4807db375.png><p>But there are living organisms that can survive even there. One bacterial species was thriving in&nbsp;outer space near the International Space Station for three years! These bacteria don’t mind the vacuum and a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;oxygen. They even managed to&nbsp;survive strong solar radiation. They rightfully deserve the title of&nbsp;the world’s most resistant bacteria!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMawwYycmKdllJ7DpnnOp6OyZWJivKd5zJqpopmelnq1vsSnmqFlpJ2yr3nTq6aumpyaerTAwKurrGVoZoFzfZRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./0-16641-19491121-00-html.html><span>←</span><span>TIME Magazine Cover: Robert M.
