Hed enjoyed sports, especially basketball, but his size made it hard to stay active. Instead, he retreated further into food. I would binge eat as much as I wanted, and whatever I wanted, pretty much all day, often eating until I felt sick to my stomach, he says. I became lazier and more dependent on food as not only a way to fill me up, but almost a hobby. It was something I looked forward to; stuffing my face and eating to capacity was something I hated enjoying.</p><p>He remembers the exact day of his heaviest recorded weight: April 3rd, 2018. That day, Thaher was 19 years old, and weighed 438 pounds. Hed become depressed and self-isolating, dropping out of school. That day, looking at the scale, he dedicated himself to changing. I felt ashamed and disappointed with how far I let myself go, he says. I was determined to change and finally take control of my life again.</p><p>Starting off, Thaher says, I really went into it with an all-in mindset. That meant hitting the gym every day, even as he learned the basics thanks to friends and online tutorials. At his size, he initially stuck to low-intensity cardio, biking or walking on the treadmill while he stoked his resolve. I needed to prove to myself I had the potential to get it done and I didnt have to be the person I was before I started this journey, he says. Hes now doing a <a href=# id=29db539b-ae8e-3d19-ad17-9797f5c697f9>six-day push-pull leg routine</a> along with at least four days of <a href=# id=3ac36eca-be7e-342c-aec2-c3f2bd662a53>cardio (usually HIIT)</a> a week. Hes on a high-protein, low-carb diet with <a href=# id=b87d7c2e-9f27-396a-ab7f-e5596d248a64>IF/OMAD (intermittent fasting/one meal a day).</a></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8cf3d8f4-7926-3046-a6c6-02206e5efba7 data-caption="How This Guy Lost 200 Pounds and Got Jacked"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/1vrktkuTURBXy9lYWU2NGVmNy1mZDE5LTRiMDEtOGY4My03ZTFiOGMxYjk4ODQuanBlZ5GVAs0DFs0Bi8LD></span><p>In just over 16 months, hes lost more than 200 pounds. Hed like to lose 20 to 30 more pounds; 17 pounds would get him to 219, half his weight when he started. Once hes satisfied with his weight, he wants to <a href=# id=4516a47e-5f85-3ec0-a155-d8712fb3b92d>start bodybuilding, to add muscle mass and strength</a> . I am nowhere close to finished; I am actually just getting started, he says. I have so much planned to help not only myself but as well as the community and to spread a positive message.</p><p>Thaher says dropping the weight has really given him a purpose. I want to set an example and help inspire others to become a better version of themselves, whether that means losing 20 pounds or whatever else, he says. I am as well physically and mentally feeling better than ever, and continue to get more confident with who I am on the inside and out every day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLqmutJmn56ZnKm1cMDHoqpmn6WueqS0wKeenpxdnba0ecyipZ2rlal6tbuMpaasnV2ivLOxjK2fmqZdZ31xec%2BorKeco2Kur7CMoJytZZqWsKyxw2hwsGmYm36t</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./9276-men-dont-think-tinder-cheating.html><span>←</span><span>Men don't think Tinder is cheating - but women do</span></a>
