We have four children (22,16,14 and 11) and up until the last few months, I genuinely thought that we could work through anything. This is not the only situation that has happened in the last few years, just the one that finally broke me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9f1/31e/29f0d052ef9485e688dc773c09.jpg><p>I recently had a birthday and Sam planned a surprise birthday party for me. He spilled the beans to me 3 days before the party, and I thought it was adorable that he was so excited about the party that he couldn't contain himself.</p><p>I wish this was the case, instead, he told me that I needed to help him clean the house to get it ready for my party. Yes, you read that right, I needed to prepare food and set up the house for my own party.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/21a/11a/c25cfc503685a861a64aeb2988.jpg><p>I agreed to clean to keep the peace, but I was upset. The day of the party quickly came, and I was devastated to learn that he didn't invite most of my <a href=# title=friends data-link=tag>friends</a> or <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>. He claimed that he didn't know how to contact them.</p><p>The final straw came when he carried out a cake in a flavor that he loved, nothing that I would ever choose for myself. I barely managed to keep it in and cried in the bathroom after everyone left.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d96/fba/9674235d248be45235eecb8ade.jpg><p>I felt like an afterthought and hated listening to everyone compliment him for throwing me a party. I work two jobs, take care of the kids, and plan meals, grocery shopping, and most of the housework. I am exhausted and just want to feel appreciated for a day.</p><p>Am I wrong for considering divorce because I feel he doesn't care? I just can't imagine throwing away 10 years of <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>, but I feel broken.</p><p><h2>People stood on&nbsp;her side.</h2></p><ul><li>"Tell him, 'I hope you enjoyed your birthday party, now I don’t have to throw you one when it’s your birthday.'" <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Old_Beach2325 / Reddit</a></li><li>"The reason for your divorce isn’t a cake or the party. It’s his self-centeredness. He decided to throw a party. The reason he gave his guests was your birthday, but it was for himself.<br>He wasn’t excited about the party and told you early, he needed you to clean and organize everything for it. He only invited his friends and family. Ten-plus years in and he can’t contact your friends and family.<br>He bought his favorite cake. He took all of the accolades and credit. You don’t need someone in your life that has you feeling sad, unworthy, and used." <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Realistic-Animator-3 / Reddit</a></li><li>"His excuse that he didn’t contact her family because he didn’t know their contact info is bunk, too. Once he blew the secret so she could clean the house and cook, he could have asked how to contact them then or even asked her to contact them if he hates them." <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mentat70 / Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/954/602/1ec63752778062fd4c4d406066.jpg><ul><li>"I think you should organize a night out with your friends for your birthday. The ones he didn’t invite. Then order your fav cake and bring it to the bar that you start the night in and have drinks, cake and a husband-free birthday!<br>Oh, and by night out I mean in another city, so it’s an overnight away! He can look after the kids." <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Peanutsandcheese2021 / Reddit</a></li><li>"I get it. You want to feel seen. After 10 years, you deserve a partner that sees you, knows what's important to you, values you, and actually shows it." <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>TheRadiumGirl / Reddit</a></li><li>"This is exactly what my parent’s marriage was like for over 20 years… they are both infinitely happier divorced. Seeing my mom free of my dad’s treatment of her and watching her healing journey healed something in me, too.<br>Get out and don’t look back. There are so many avenues you can take to reach your happiness, but waiting and hoping he’ll become a more attentive, less self-centered person is not one of them." <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>BrotatochipDG / Reddit</a></li></ul><p>This wasn’t just about one misguided event but a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;deeper issues in&nbsp;their marriage that have been ignored for too long. The <a href=#>disconnect</a>, the lack of&nbsp;understanding, and the disregard for her true self have become too significant to&nbsp;overlook.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZutMCtnJ1lpJ2ybr%2FUq6eroaOaeqO10a2fnZmpYr2ivtOyZKaxXZ3CtK7Ap5tmrJinsrh5zJ5kmqaUYruww4yiZLCZnql6onnDoq2oqpOaenl9mHFrcGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1153919-difference-porridge-pottage-html.html><span>←</span><span>Difference between porridge and pottage</span></a>
