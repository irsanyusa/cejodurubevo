So&nbsp;let’s do&nbsp;Barbie justice together.</p><p><h2>Barbie was the first doll not intended for mommy play.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1a6/b64/3248a85b5db34228f1ba2347e2.jpg><p>Before Barbie was released, little girls only played with Betsy Wetsy, Tiny Tears, and Chatty Cathy&nbsp;— baby dolls that encouraged them to&nbsp;hold and care for babies. It&nbsp;mirrored society’s expectation of&nbsp;girls to&nbsp;grow up&nbsp;into nurturing mothers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ea7/af2/21ede55d79bc17cae63c4c37ca.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c4f/909/249b445ea1803d80d724950091.jpg><p>Barbie’s creator, Ruth Handler, while watching her own daughter and her friends, <a href=#>realized</a> that girls didn’t want to&nbsp;just play “mommy” with their dolls. So, she conceived Barbie as&nbsp;a&nbsp;hip bombshell teen with her own apartment, her own car, and her own job. Barbie rejected the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman as&nbsp;a&nbsp;housewife. And, to&nbsp;everyone’s surprise, her sales skyrocketed. Little girls didn’t want to&nbsp;play mommy after all.</p><p><h2>Barbie had careers that weren’t available for women back in&nbsp;the time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f9f/619/85a8af548a968a51935fcf15da.jpg><p>Barbie launched in&nbsp;<a href=#>1959</a>, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;time when it&nbsp;was taboo for women to&nbsp;work, and even more so&nbsp;for girls to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;work. Yet, Barbie had a&nbsp;job&nbsp;— she was a&nbsp;fashion model. In&nbsp;her <a href=#>early years</a>, she was also a&nbsp;Business Executive (a&nbsp;woman in&nbsp;a&nbsp;position of&nbsp;power!), a&nbsp;presidential candidate (long before women could actually run for president), and an&nbsp;astronaut (Barbie landed on&nbsp;the moon 4&nbsp;years before Neil Armstrong).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cee/75a/81a19353f4b23308f2fc0277c2.jpg><p>Barbie’s more modern professions include game developer, lab scientist, and robotics engineer&nbsp;— very male-dominated fields, even now. Barbie, and all of&nbsp;her careers, <a href=#>influenced</a> the image of&nbsp;how a&nbsp;woman could work, have autonomy, and be&nbsp;in&nbsp;control. She <a href=#>showed</a> little girls all the things they could&nbsp;be.</p><p><h2>Barbie always strived for diversity.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0fc/31c/3db1db59988f360b99ad104086.jpg><p>Early&nbsp;on, the toy company Mattel that created Barbie introduced African-American dolls. Black dolls&nbsp;— Barbie’s friends&nbsp;— have been <a href=#>in&nbsp;circulation</a> since 1967&nbsp;as a&nbsp;statement during the rise of&nbsp;the civil rights movement in&nbsp;the US. In&nbsp;1980, the first <a href=#>Black Barbie</a> herself arrived with a&nbsp;curly afro and a&nbsp;ruby red dress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8fe/664/25c68551bcb08d8691e7eb85fd.jpg><p>Nowadays, Mattel has started to&nbsp;launch dolls with more realistic body sizes and disabilities&nbsp;— to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more inclusive and representative of&nbsp;more identities. Not only does modern Barbie come in&nbsp;several body types and skin tones, but she can also have no&nbsp;hair, wear hijab, have a&nbsp;prosthetic leg, have vitiligo, or&nbsp;use a&nbsp;wheelchair. Anyone can find themselves in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Barbie doll.</p><p><h2>Barbie shows that you can be&nbsp;pretty and aspirational at&nbsp;the same time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3dd/dff/5c2ada5b69b2dec82506a6807e.jpg><p>Not very long ago, beautiful girls who liked pink and had blonde hair were often considered shallow, and surely not serious about their career. Barbie was the first doll to&nbsp;<a href=#>show</a> girls that they could be&nbsp;both pretty and ambitious, have sophisticated interests, and like dressing&nbsp;up, glamour, and glitz.</p><p>From her debut, Barbie has tried over <a href=#>200 careers</a>&nbsp;— one of&nbsp;the most impressive résumés out there. Barbie encouraged girls to&nbsp;believe in&nbsp;themselves, hailing both self-acceptance and self-reinvention.</p><p><h2>Barbie educates children on&nbsp;women’s history.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7da/dc8/f5c7f553668c31a50796d67757.jpg><p>Mattel launched the “<a href=#>Sheroes</a>” and “<a href=#>Inspiring Women</a>” series with <strong>dolls designed after famous women</strong>: artist Frida Kahlo, astronaut Sally Ride, first female aviator Amelia Earhart, Olympian gymnast Gabby Douglas, and many others. Barbie introduces these inspirational, real-life role models to&nbsp;young girls, illustrating women’s impact on&nbsp;science, culture, and history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/803/3d6/6ca68d50038da8526fd1b26aa4.jpg><p><h2>Barbie uses her platform to&nbsp;address difficult topics.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e8/d92/4b44d65594ac74eed2091b19ae.jpg><p>It&nbsp;will probably take you by&nbsp;surprise to&nbsp;learn that Barbie has a&nbsp;vlog. In&nbsp;her YouTube videos, she participates in&nbsp;viral YouTube challenges and discusses everything from baking to&nbsp;<a href=#>depression</a>. In&nbsp;the series of&nbsp;videos, Barbie breaks down the “<a href=#>dream gap</a>”&nbsp;— a&nbsp;phenomenon, where girls begin to&nbsp;doubt their competence from the age of&nbsp;6, and it&nbsp;teaches them how to&nbsp;build their confidence back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/312/b44/0925df5162aaf281674e8e2f63.jpg><p>Furthermore, Barbie highlights a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;good causes on&nbsp;her platform, including conservation, via a&nbsp;<a href=#>partnership</a> with National Geographic.</p><p><h2>Barbie never got married.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d51/070/2f1c6453e9812b40963f93b5a9.jpg><p>Barbie’s creator made a&nbsp;<a href=#>point</a> of&nbsp;having <strong>Ken be&nbsp;Barbie’s boyfriend and sidekick, but never her husband</strong>. Barbie should always be&nbsp;the main star. Since 1961, Barbie and Ken have been on&nbsp;and off until they officially <a href=#>broke up</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;2004 for the first time due to&nbsp;Ken’s inability to&nbsp;commit. But Barbie ran for president that same year, so&nbsp;she clearly had no&nbsp;time for drama.</p><p>By&nbsp;being the world’s most famous doll while unmarried and with an&nbsp;identity all her own, she normalized the same for everyone else.</p><p>What was your favorite childhood toy?
