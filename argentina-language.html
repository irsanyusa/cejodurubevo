Almost all of them speak Spanish. Though there is no official language in Argentina, Spanish is the main language. At 1.4 times the size of Mexico, it is the largest Spanish-speaking nation in the world. If you have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">studied Spanish</a> in another country, the Spanish you hear in Argentina may sound a little different. A dialect of Spanish called Rioplatense is spoken in most of Argentina.&nbsp;</p><p>Many indigenous languages can also be found in Argentina. Also, immigrants from Europe have settled in Argentina so you may hear Italian, German, English and more.</p><p>In this article we’ll learn about the languages spoken in Argentina, the Rioplatense dialect and some differences between <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish</a> in Argentina and Spain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-language-do-they-speak-in-Argentina?>What language do they speak in Argentina?</h2><p>Argentina has a large indigenous population. There are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">14 indigenous languages</a> spoken by 39 indigenous groups in Argentina. Quechua is a language spoken in Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador.&nbsp;</p><p>Guaraní is an indigenous language spoken mainly in the north of Argentina, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">which borders Paraguay</a>. It is one of the official languages of Paraguay.&nbsp;</p><p>Another major indigenous language is Mapudungun. Mapudungun is spoken by the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mapuche</a> people, an indigenous group living in Chile and southwestern Argentina.&nbsp;</p><p>Europeans first arrived in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">present day Argentina</a> in 1502 from Portugal. The Spanish arrived shortly after in 1516 and quickly colonized the region. Many indigenous people had been living in this region and indigenous languages are still spoken in Argentina. Due to the influence and control of Spain, Spanish became the prominent language. Spanish is spoken as the first or second language by most Argentinians.&nbsp;</p><p>Argentina gained independence from Spain in 1816 and encouraged immigration. An estimated <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">7 million people immigrated</a> to Argentina between 1870 and 1930. Many of those immigrants came from Italy. Italian is spoken by about 1.5 million people in Argentina. This may come as a surprise, but Arabic is spoken by about 1 million people. Many people from Syria and Lebanon immigrated to Argentina in the 19th century. You will also hear German, Yiddish and English spoken.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How many languages are spoken in Argentina?</h3><p>It is hard to say exactly how many languages are spoken in Argentina today. Between over 14 indigenous languages, Spanish, and other European languages, there are more than 20 languages spoken in Argentina.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What’s-the-difference-between-Spanish-in-Argentina-and-Spanish-in-Spain?-->What’s the difference between Spanish in Argentina and Spanish in Spain?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>What is different about the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish Argentinians</a> speak?

Rioplatense is spoken in the media and in large cities in Argentina such as Buenos Aires, Rosario and Santa Fe.&nbsp;</p><p>Some characteristics of Rioplatense Spanish:</p><ul><li>Tends to borrow technical words from American English. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish spoken in Spain</a> tends to borrow them from British English or from French.</li><li>Uses the voseo verb form. The pronoun vos (you) is used instead of tú (you, informal).&nbsp;</li><li>Vosotros (you, plural) which is used in Spain is replaced with ustedes (you, plural). This is common in most <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Latin American countries</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>The double-L sound ll is pronounced like the English /sh/ as in “should” rather than as /y/ (yeísmo) which is common in the rest of the Spanish-speaking world.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Rioplatense also has many words that differ from Spanish:</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td>English</td><td>Spanish</td><td>Rioplatense</td></tr><tr><td>Potato</td><td>Patata</td><td>Papa</td></tr><tr><td>Peach</td><td>Melecotón</td><td>Durazno&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Hot dog</td><td>Perrito</td><td>Pancho</td></tr><tr><td>Bowtie</td><td>Pajarita</td><td>Moño</td></tr><tr><td>Cell phone</td><td>Móvil</td><td>Celular</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Language diversity in Argentina</h2><p>There are many unique languages spoken in Argentina on a daily basis.
