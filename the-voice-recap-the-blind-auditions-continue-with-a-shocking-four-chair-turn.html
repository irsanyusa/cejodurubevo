The coaches continued to fill up their teams, and Kelly Clarkson finally used her block. That means the coaches have no more blocks for the rest of the auditions.</strong></p><p>There were three four-chair turns in Monday and Tuesday’s episodes. One of those auditions was especially shocking, as the judges couldn’t believe who they were looking at when they turned around. Check out which artists made it onto the coaches’ teams below.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mendeleyev-team-john>Mendeleyev (Team John)</h4><p>This singer and guitarist recently lost his mother to cancer.
