Keke Palmer’s example is&nbsp;just another showcase that people will judge a&nbsp;woman for her choices no&nbsp;matter how close they are to&nbsp;them.</p><p><h2>The famous actress gave birth to&nbsp;her child in&nbsp;February 2023.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dd6/fd1/ac090955ed8780f1eb5e991439.jpg><p>NDZ/STAR MAX/IPx/Associated Press/East News</p><p>Keke has been very private with her personal life throughout her career, but <strong>in&nbsp;December 2022 she shared massive news</strong>. While hosting <i>Saturday Night Live,</i> she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announced</a> that she is&nbsp;<a href=#>expecting</a> her first child with her partner Darius Jackson. That was also the first time the world was learning about her partner and father of&nbsp;her child. And even after the <a href=#>birth</a>, Palmer has been sharing very few pictures and videos of&nbsp;her child, trying to&nbsp;maintain her family’s privacy.</p><p><h2>The new mom enjoyed a&nbsp;night out with friends.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fd1/7c1/53aa935c9e9aea92018d692002.jpg><p>Keke attended the venue where Usher is&nbsp;performing in&nbsp;Las Vegas and at&nbsp;some point the singer approached her. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>viral clip</a>, <strong>he&nbsp;can be&nbsp;seen and heard serenading Keke</strong>, with her going along with the performance and having a&nbsp;great time. In&nbsp;the video, people can also see her wonderful <a href=# title=dress data-link=tag>dress</a>, which is&nbsp;sheer on&nbsp;the legs and upper chest. While she was looking fabulous, it&nbsp;seemed that someone is&nbsp;particular had an&nbsp;issue with her <a href=# title=wardrobe data-link=tag>wardrobe</a> choice.</p><p><h2>Darius shamed Keke for her dress through a&nbsp;tweet.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b07/bf2/01f40b52f8a9f053bb183c8231.jpg><p>The partner of&nbsp;Keke didn’t seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;fan of&nbsp;her outfit and lashed on&nbsp;Twitter <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “It’s the outfit tho.. you a&nbsp;mom.” It&nbsp;didn’t take long for people to&nbsp;go&nbsp;against him and criticize him for his response, but he&nbsp;doubled down further <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>supporting</a> his views.</p><p>“We&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;generation where a&nbsp;man of&nbsp;the family doesn’t want the wife and mother to&nbsp;his kids to&nbsp;showcase booty cheeks to&nbsp;please others, and he&nbsp;gets told how much of&nbsp;a&nbsp;hater he&nbsp;is. <strong>This is&nbsp;my&nbsp;family and my&nbsp;representation. I&nbsp;have standards and morals</strong> to&nbsp;what I&nbsp;believe. I&nbsp;rest my&nbsp;case.”</p><p><h2>Keke clapped back in&nbsp;the classiest way she could.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bad/85c/e499fd57b7809b212eeda8807b.jpg><p>Many people came to&nbsp;Keke’s defense, with one person saying, “You don’t criticize the mother of&nbsp;your children publicly. End of&nbsp;discussion,” and someone else added, “Don’t let baby daddy dictate what you wear!”</p><p>While Palmer didn’t respond to&nbsp;the whole situation quickly, she did <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>share</a> a&nbsp;post with the caption “<strong>One thing is&nbsp;certain, and one thing is&nbsp;true, I’M&nbsp;A MOTHA</strong>, through and through! To&nbsp;all my&nbsp;moms out there, how did your baby change you? Mine empowered&nbsp;me! On&nbsp;such another level, my&nbsp;perspective changed because when my&nbsp;baby is&nbsp;good I’m GREAT! Look at&nbsp;that face! Gratitude galore.”</p><p>She also posted a&nbsp;video on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>TikTok</a>, where she is&nbsp;seen dancing to&nbsp;a&nbsp;song with the lyrics “You ain’t stopping what’s going on&nbsp;with&nbsp;me, sweetheart. So, if&nbsp;you’re about to&nbsp;act&nbsp;up, I’m ’bout to&nbsp;link&nbsp;up.” It’s quite obvious that Keke won’t back down just because her partner shamed her and if&nbsp;one thing is&nbsp;for sure is&nbsp;that she has the internet by&nbsp;her side.</p><p><a href=#>Double standards</a> are so&nbsp;prevalent in&nbsp;our society, but women appear to&nbsp;be&nbsp;willing to&nbsp;<a href=#>break</a> as&nbsp;many of&nbsp;them as&nbsp;possible. But these standards also <a href=#>apply to&nbsp;men</a> and limit them and their reactions to&nbsp;certain events.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMawwdGeZJplnaS6brfEpJxmqJGhuqa%2B0maZqLGWp7amusNmqqGZnZqxbrTEq2Sfp6Jitaa%2BjKisrZ6ZqXqiusNmnqisXZZ6s7HSqaanq5VitaZ5w6Kbp6xdmsWxscKtZHFpY26Fdns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./apprentissage-xavier-bertrand-affiche-son-soutien-la-reforme-malgre-lopposition-de-regions-de.html><span>←</span><span>Xavier Bertrand affiche son soutien la rforme malgr l'opposition de Rgions de France</span></a>
