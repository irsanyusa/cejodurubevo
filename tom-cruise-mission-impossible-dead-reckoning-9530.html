It’s this man, Mr. Tom Cruise. When this whole process started four years ago, we were entering a period where it looked like this event was headed for extinction. It was a very real possibility that this medium that we loved so much was on its way out. One person said, ‘No, we’re gonna keep it going’. And that’s this man right here,” McQuarrie said.</p><p>The Sydney premiere fell on Cruise’s 61st birthday, however both McQuarrie and the star himself insisted there was nowhere he’d rather be.</p><p><span>“I think he deserves a big hand,” McQuarrie said of Cruise. “He loves this medium and l<a href=#>oves entertaining a big audience</a> on the big screen. </span><span>And I want you to remember that when he’s throwing himself off a cliff later, he did it for you. He didn’t do it for me. He did it for you.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>For his part, Cruise said it was amazing to be back <a href=# rel=noopener>making big blockbuster films</a> for audiences to enjoy.</p><p>“When to see how much an audience enjoys it [it’s amazing],” he said. “I make my movies for you all, all my movies I make, and I’m dreaming and I’m thinking about this experience and to see how much you all enjoy it, that such a gift to me.”</p><p>As for whether there will be any other “Mission: Impossible” films in the franchise following “Dead Reckoning – Part Two”, Cruise simply said “talk to me next year”. He did, however, concede there were more stunts and adventures he wanted to partake in.</p><p>“There’s always another mountain, there’s always something else, but let’s enjoy this evening first,” he said.</p><h2 id=optional-screen-reader class=lrv-a-screen-reader-only>optional screen reader</h2><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-family-secondary o-nav__title a-content-ignore u-line-height-140 u-letter-spacing-0002">Read More About:</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpWPDor7InquyZpOkunB%2Bj2tqaJ6ZobpwusSwqmisn6J6pL7UoqqeZZ2ewLS1zqdkoqWgpMC0tcGlnGaclZaxbr7EnKKoppmjtG6FlGxnaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./de-nouvelles-mesures-pour-soutenir-le-monde-rural.html><span>←</span><span>De nouvelles mesures pour soutenir le monde rural</span></a>
