A&nbsp;partner usually acts this way because of&nbsp;their fear of&nbsp;losing the person they’re with.

That’s why they want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with them all the time and know their every move 24/7.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>would like to&nbsp;ring the bell on&nbsp;8&nbsp;signs that your partner is&nbsp;overprotective and 3&nbsp;ways you can try to&nbsp;solve that behavior.</p><p><h2>Sign&nbsp;1: They express their deep love very early.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/679/665/0e3ef25fb3bd731b8f57cd90ba.jpg><p>Instead of&nbsp;waiting to&nbsp;see where the <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> is&nbsp;going, a&nbsp;controlling person will profess their deep <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> early&nbsp;on. Not only that, but they will push you to&nbsp;make the same <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>declaration</a> of&nbsp;commitment. <strong>They will probably flatter you</strong> by&nbsp;saying how you make their life so&nbsp;much better and force you to&nbsp;try and feel the same. This is&nbsp;their effort to&nbsp;tie you down from the beginning so&nbsp;they know that you are in&nbsp;an&nbsp;exclusive and devoted relationship.</p><p><h2>Sign&nbsp;2: They are jealous and interrogate you about everything.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c6/3fd/2c0ad9534097ff18a756a18410.jpg><p>They think that the entire population has a&nbsp;crush on&nbsp;you and that you might be&nbsp;flirting with everyone else. They are <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>insecure</a> and make it&nbsp;look like your actions are responsible for their feelings. That’s why <strong>they are always asking questions</strong> about where you were, who you were with, and what you were talking about. The moment they hear you talking about an&nbsp;ex-partner or&nbsp;someone they consider a&nbsp;rival, they become enraged and create a&nbsp;big scene.</p><p><h2>Sign&nbsp;3: They try to&nbsp;cut you off from your friends and especially those of&nbsp;the opposite sex.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/44e/dac/8f347e5157a1667544419a4e44.jpg><p>They don’t want you to&nbsp;hang out with friends since they want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the focal point of&nbsp;your entire life. They don’t understand that you have a&nbsp;life away from them and they try to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>isolate</a> you from your friends. Not only that, but <strong>they might make you feel </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><strong>guilty</strong></a><strong> for leaving them alone</strong> and choosing to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out with your friends instead. They make you feel like an&nbsp;inconsiderate partner who doesn’t care as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;you should about your boyfriend/girlfriend.</p><p><h2>Sign&nbsp;4: They blame you for their negative feelings and actions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d00/928/0b6d825589a75465defff84674.jpg><p>When you fight and they get angry very easily, they blame you for their feelings. Instead of&nbsp;saying “I&nbsp;feel angry,” they will say “You make me&nbsp;so&nbsp;angry.” <strong>They will masterfully twist things around</strong> so&nbsp;they are never to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>blame</a>, but you are the evil person who always diminishes them. Even if&nbsp;they make a&nbsp;mistake outside of&nbsp;your relationship, they will find someone else to&nbsp;blame for their misbehavior.</p><p><h2>Sign&nbsp;5: They tell you what you can and can’t wear.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/065/a00/ca07be5a19ac2e0e30825db2fc.jpg><p>An&nbsp;overprotective partner doesn’t understand that you don’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>dress</a> for the crowds, but for yourself only. Controlling what you wear shows that they are unreasonably jealous of&nbsp;you and insecure about your relationship. <strong>They don’t want people around you to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;you</strong> and that’s why they prefer having you dressed more conservatively. The moment you start thinking about whether your clothing will be&nbsp;approved by&nbsp;your partner, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;certain that you are in&nbsp;an&nbsp;oppressive relationship.</p><p><h2>Sign&nbsp;6: They check your phone and your location at&nbsp;all times.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d88/6d1/7e4150577db829ff273b751b80.jpg><p>Just because you are in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship doesn’t mean that your personal space is&nbsp;gone. It’s only natural that your partner will want to&nbsp;know where you are and who you’re with, but not if&nbsp;it&nbsp;becomes an&nbsp;obsession. Nobody has the right to&nbsp;check your <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>phone</a> whenever they want without your permission. Some partners will also go&nbsp;as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;<strong>installing a&nbsp;tracking app on&nbsp;your phone</strong> so&nbsp;they know where you are at&nbsp;all times.</p><p><h2>Sign&nbsp;7: They follow you everywhere claiming it’s for your safety.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/473/9fc/41808d5405bc450f90bbb3c944.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Overprotective</a> partners think you are only safe when they are around and in&nbsp;danger when you’re on&nbsp;your own. That’s why they want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with you all the time and even follow you to&nbsp;your car to&nbsp;make sure it&nbsp;starts. They will probably also <strong>come to&nbsp;your medical appointments with you</strong> and demand that you ask for their opinion on&nbsp;everything having to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with your life. They also don’t think it’s weird if&nbsp;they always want to&nbsp;come with you when you go&nbsp;out with your friends.</p><p>They might also get really <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>angry</a> if&nbsp;you don’t answer your phone right away and complain to&nbsp;you about&nbsp;it. Now, this behavior itself isn’t always alarming, but it’s probably a&nbsp;problem if&nbsp;they don’t seem to&nbsp;understand your explanations. If&nbsp;<strong>your needs and opinions are always perceived as&nbsp;wrong</strong> and you always need to&nbsp;agree with them, then something isn’t quite right.</p><p><h2>Sign&nbsp;8: They have unreasonable expectations of&nbsp;you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/62c/b35/d2f0fc545f922da744e7234a21.jpg><p>They might demand that you spend all your free time with them or&nbsp;that you look a&nbsp;specific way. They might also <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>expect</a> you to&nbsp;not have friends of&nbsp;the opposite sex or&nbsp;for you to&nbsp;side with them in&nbsp;every disagreement with your mutual friends. However, these are not things that they will necessarily share with you from the start, but they will fight with you about them later&nbsp;on. You need to&nbsp;keep in&nbsp;mind that <strong>you are not there to&nbsp;satisfy your partner’s every void</strong>, but only to&nbsp;add to&nbsp;their happiness.</p><p><h2>Solution&nbsp;1: Stand your ground and set your rules.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/627/22f/36a2b0566ea2b0181942d0e572.jpg><p>Once you’ve understood your partner’s behavior, you can have an&nbsp;honest <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>conversation</a> and set your rules. You are willing to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;few compromises, but not at&nbsp;the expense of&nbsp;your own happiness. For example, it’s not fair for your partner to&nbsp;ask you to&nbsp;distance yourself from your friends. You have to&nbsp;let them know that <strong>they will also need to&nbsp;make compromises</strong> and accept some of&nbsp;the things that you want to&nbsp;keep doing.</p><p><h2>Solution&nbsp;2: Introduce them to&nbsp;your circle of&nbsp;friends.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ab2/97e/2d8aa05b44a4838fa4bff3046f.jpg><p>If&nbsp;your partner is&nbsp;jealous of&nbsp;your <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>friends</a> of&nbsp;the opposite sex and the rest of&nbsp;your friends, you can always bring them with you. They will see that <strong>everyone is&nbsp;very respectful of&nbsp;you</strong> and that no&nbsp;one is&nbsp;flirtatious toward you. And if&nbsp;you have very little free time in&nbsp;your life, you can combine your relationship with your friends every once in&nbsp;a&nbsp;while. You also show them that you have nothing to&nbsp;hide and that your friends are also their friends if&nbsp;they want to&nbsp;get closer to&nbsp;them.</p><p><h2>Solution&nbsp;3: Do&nbsp;some reverse psychology.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b18/50b/e95807541c9a6d54605c9e2eae.jpg><p>Doing to&nbsp;them what they are doing to&nbsp;you might work nicely with your overprotective <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>partner</a>. If&nbsp;for example, they get jealous of&nbsp;your friends, you can act the same way after they go&nbsp;out with theirs. <strong>They will probably defend themselves</strong> and reassure you about their decent behavior. This way you will make them feel how their overprotectiveness affects you and they might see that they need to&nbsp;change.</p><p>Have you ever been in&nbsp;an&nbsp;overprotective/obsessive relationship?
