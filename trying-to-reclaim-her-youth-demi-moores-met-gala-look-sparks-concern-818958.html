To complete her ensemble, Demi chose sparkling diamonds from <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Cartier</a>. Her hair was styled in a sleek <a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a>, and makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury gave her a subtle look to ensure the gown remained the center of attention.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9bf/69a/b62cb75aa4b4ec8d046dce8e92.jpg><p>DPRF/STAR MAX/IPx/Associated Press/East News</p><p>The designer behind this creation, Harris Reed, took inspiration from a Cartier necklace and transformed wallpaper into a fashionable masterpiece. The silk embroidery work alone on the dress took 11,000 hours, symbolizing Demi’s re-emergence on the red carpet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/218/52f/d6698455dea2e65825c92efb7d.jpg><p>DPRF/STAR MAX/IPx/Associated Press/East News</p><p>She is too beautiful to wear such a hideous dress</p><p>Reed described his design as if he were the vines supporting Demi’s blossoming presence, and the dress’s floral pattern, named Chloris, is a nod to the Greek nymph of flowers. During a chat with Ashley Graham, Demi <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> that despite its appearance, the gown felt light and even made her “want to rumba.”<br>The reception to Demi’s outfit was mixed. Some were in awe, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “Wow, best outfit of the night. Truly stunning,” while others were less favorable, commenting, “Too old and...trying to reclaim her youth”. Some also compared her with her old self and pointed out her changed appearance, "She looks like a different person. Not good."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/86e/605/4c67135199b882051bfbc14b39.jpg><p>Invision/Invision/East News<span>, </span>Marechal Aurore/ABACA/Abaca/East News</p><p>Demi also turned heads recently with her age-defying appearance at another major fashion event.
