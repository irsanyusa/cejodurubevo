Or perhaps we just want to hit the open road with nothing but a change of clothes and a good soundtrack. But while this style of packing may seem light and free, the reality of travel usually necessitates bringing along a few more items… possibly even two suitcases’ worth, between the carry-on and the checked bag. If you travel for extended periods, a larger suitcase can keep you prepared and supplied with everything you need, while a carry-on is great for shorter trips or additional packing room. So why not save money and time by buying a luggage set?</p><p>Luggage sets are a cost-effective, versatile way to pack for your next trip. Buying a set ensures that all your bags meet your needs, while looking cohesive. You won’t need to bring the full set on every trip, depending on how long you go for and who you’re traveling with, but owning a luggage set gives you options when it comes to deciding what to bring. Bundling suitcases together is always more affordable than buying pieces individually, and you can put those savings towards your next trip.</p><p>Of course, different kinds of travelers will look for different qualities in their luggage. I’ve put together this list of the best luggage sets to address a variety of needs and priorities.</p><h2 id=our-picks-for-the-best-luggage-sets>Our picks for the best luggage sets</h2><h3>Best hardside luggage set: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Samsonite Freeform Hardside Expandable Luggage Set</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best hardside luggage set</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Samsonite Freeform Hardside Expandable Luggage Set</h3></p><p>Fans of <a rel=alternate href=#>hardside luggage</a> will delight in the Samsonite Freeform Hardside Expandable Luggage Set, which features two of the brand’s most beloved suitcases: the 21-inch carry-on and the 28-inch checked bag. Made of very durable yet lightweight polypropylene, these cases can handle pretty much anything that’s thrown at them and look stylish the whole time. Both cases are able to fit a substantial amount of clothing in their regular setting, but you can also expand the sides by two inches for additional space.</p><p>Even when full, these bags are easy to maneuver, with four multi-directional two spinner wheels for easy gliding. Multiple internal pockets and a cross-way strap helps to keep things organized inside. The Samsonite Freeform set is available in several fun colors, in addition to the standard black, gray, and navy, and features a recessed TSA combination lock for added security. The price is a little higher than some others on this list, but you’re getting significant value for that cost.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Number of pieces: 2</li><li>Dimensions:21.25 x 15.25 x 10 inches (carry-on), 27.6 x 20 x 13 inches (checked bag)</li><li>Weight: 6.5 pounds (21 inch), 9.5 pounds (28 inches)</li><li>Material: Polypropylene</li><li>Expandable: Yes</li><li>Price on publish: $359.99 - 489.99 depending on the color</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Material is durable, resistant to scuffs, and lightweight</li><li>Storage space is capacious, with additional room available with the expandable function&nbsp;</li><li>10-year limited warranty makes this a solid long-term investment</li><li>Several colorways to choose from</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Slightly higher price tag</li><li>No laundry bag or dirty laundry pocket inside</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>For the perfect blend of durability, performance and style, it’s hard to go wrong with the Samsonite Freeform luggage set.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Samsonite Freeform Hardside Expandable Luggage Set</a></p><h3>Best soft luggage set: <a rel=nofollow href=#>TravelPro Platinum Elite 3-Piece Set</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best soft luggage set</span></p><p><h3 class=title>TravelPro Platinum Elite 3-Piece Set</h3></p><p>Contrary to popular belief, softside cases are actually considered to be more durable in the long run than hardside shells, thanks to the improved fabric flexibility. With the TravelPro Platinum Elite 3-Piece Set, there is also no worry about durability or exposure to the elements: these suitcases all feature a DuraGuard coating and are scuff- and scratch-resistant. This particular set offers three sizes of suitcase, so that travelers can choose the right fit for different trips; the largest one comes in at 29.5 inches.</p><p>While some users note that this luggage can accommodate slightly less storage than other suitcases of the same size, the space you do have is nicely organized thanks to the inclusion of removable wet pockets and fold-out suiters for hanging clothes. The carry-on also features a USB charging port and space for a removable battery (although the battery itself is not included with purchase.) Maneuverability is also smooth, thanks to TravelPro’s PrecisionGlide technology, airline-grade aluminum handles and 360 degree MagnaTrac self-aligning spinner wheels.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Number of pieces: 3</li><li>Dimensions: 21 x 14 x 9 inches (carry-on), 25 x 18 x 11.25 inches (medium bag), 29.5 x 20.5 x 12.75 inches (large bag)</li><li>Weight: 7.8 pounds (carry-on), 9.8 pounds (medium bag), 11.5 pounds (large bag)</li><li>Material: Nylon, with DuraGuard coating and leather accents</li><li>Expandable: Yes</li><li>Price on publish: $1015.97</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Carry-on bag features a USB port and back-up battery pocket (battery not included)</li><li>Cases include a removable wet pocket and fold-out suiter to protect hanging clothes</li><li>Limited lifetime warranty makes this a good long-term investment</li><li>Materials are high quality and durable</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>The most expensive set on this list</li><li>Smaller storage capacity than some other options, despite the larger sizes</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>For travelers who prefer a softside case with more size options, TravelPro’s Platinum Elite 3-Piece Set offers stylish performance, smart features, and great organizational inserts.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>TravelPro Platinum Elite 3-Piece Set</a></p><h3>Best affordable luggage set: <a rel=nofollow href=#>American Tourister Fieldbrook XLT Softside Upright Luggage</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best affordable luggage set</span></p><p><h3 class=title>American Tourister Fieldbrook XLT Softside Upright Luggage</h3></p><p>With this American Tourister Fieldbrook Upright Luggage Set, you can get three pieces of luggage for less than the price of a single carry-on bag at other retailers. Made of ultra lightweight polyester, these soft-sided suitcases include a personal item (boarding bag), a 21-inch carry-on bag, and a 25-inch checked bag.</p><p>You’ll find several storage pockets inside and on the soft exterior, so you can fit more than you might expect into these smaller bags. The fabric used for this set is a little thin and prone to fraying over time; frequent travelers may find the bags don’t hold up over extensive use. However, more casual travelers or those simply looking for a great deal will get a lot of value from this American Tourister Set. It’s available in three colors, including a vibrant red/black colorway, and the inline skate wheels are impressively sturdy for such a low price point.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Number of pieces: 3</li><li>Dimensions: 10 x 16 x 6.5 inches (boarding bag), 21 x 14 x 7 inches (carry-on), 25 x 16.5 x 8 inches (checked bag)</li><li>Weight: 0.83 pounds (boarding bag), 5.55 pounds (carry-on), 7 pounds (checked bag)</li><li>Material: Polyester</li><li>Expandable: No</li><li>Price on publish: $80</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Super-lightweight materials; the largest checked bag is still just seven pounds</li><li>Additional personal item included in the set</li><li>Very affordable price</li><li>Sturdy wheels and hardware (zippers and handle)</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Fabric is a little flimsy and may fray</li><li>Not as durable as others tested; may not last seasoned travelers many years</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This American Tourister Fieldbrook Set packs in a ton for the low price of $80, with three pieces of lightweight luggage and several additional storage pockets.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>American Tourister Fieldbrook XLT Softside Upright Luggage</a></p><h3>Best family luggage set: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Coolife 4 Piece Hardshell Luggage Set</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best family luggage set</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Coolife Luggage 4 Piece Set Suitcase Spinner Hardshell Lightweight TSA Lock (family set-blue1)</h3></p><p>Most sets come in combinations of two or three pieces of luggage, but Coolife offers a four-piece hardshell set for the great price of just $200. Included in this set are two sizes of carry-on bags and two sizes of checked bags, so families can divide and conquer their packing lists. The sets come in a range of fun colors, sure to appeal to adults and children alike, while the different sizes and smooth multidirectional wheels ensure that even small hands can wheel a bag through the airport.</p><p>The luggage is made of ABS, a slightly less durable blended material, and frequent travelers have commented that these bags do scuff more easily than those by other brands. However, the telescopic handles, zippers, and reinforced grip handles are sturdy and reliable trip after trip, while the side bumper feet help to elevate the suitcases off the ground and reduce wear and tear. TSA-approved combination locks are on every piece for security.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Number of pieces: 4</li><li>Dimensions: 16 x 12.75 x 8.25 inches (small carry-on), 20 x 15.5 x 9.25 inches (large carry-on), 24 x 18.25 x 10.25 inches (small checked bag), 28 x 20.75 x 11.75 inches (large checked bag)</li><li>Weight: 4.7 pounds (small carry-on), 6.3 pounds (large carry-on), 7.9 pounds (small checked bag), 10 pounds (large checked bag)</li><li>Material: ABS</li><li>Expandable: No</li><li>Price on publish: $199.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Great price for four high-quality suitcases</li><li>Nice range of sizes and colors to accommodate different family members</li><li>Good maneuvering thanks to the light weight and smooth wheels</li><li>Durable shells and details, from handles to side bumper feet for reduced wear</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Exterior is prone to scuff marks</li><li>Limited two-year warranty</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>For just $200, Coolife’s 4 Piece Hardshell Luggage Set is great value thanks to its color and size options, easy maneuvering and thoughtful design details, though it does scuff easily.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Coolife 4 Piece Hardshell Luggage Set</a></p><h3>Best luggage set on Amazon: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Amazon Basics Hardside Spinner Set</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best luggage set on Amazon</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Amazon Basics 2-Piece Luggage Sets (21", 30"), Suitcase with Wheels, Hardside Expandable Suitcase With Four Spinner Wheels and Scratch-Resistant Surface, Navy Blue</h3></p><p>The Amazon Basics line is a reliable source of everyday goods at an accessible price point and the Hardside Spinner Luggage Set is no different. With two nicely sized bags for under $200, this set offers a lot of internal storage space, organization pockets, and the capacity to expand for an additional 15% in packing space. As these two pieces are made of ABS, they are a little more prone to scuff marks than pure polypropylene or fabric, but the suitcases are still durable to withstand airport handling.</p><p>The bags each feature four double spinner wheels that make maneuvering a breeze and many Amazon customers have praised the high quality zippers. While some customers have complained about the handle feeling a little flimsy, the Basics Hardside Spinner Set counts over 34,000 five-star reviews and is a great choice for travelers who don’t want to spend too much on extra performance details.

Expandable functions give you the best of both worlds: a smaller silhouette for easier maneuverability, but the option to gain a few more inches of space on the occasions that you need it.</p><p>I like this set from TravelPro thanks to its high-grade materials and thoughtful details, like built-in USB-A and USB-C ports, multiple internal pockets, MagnaTrak self-aligning spinner wheels, and aluminum corner guards for added protection. The expandable functionality adds two inches of height to the already spacious interior, so you can be confident that you’ll be able to fit everything you need. Unfortunately, you don’t get a discount for buying the two suitcases as a set, however there is a limited lifetime warranty that makes the higher price more reasonable.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Number of pieces: 2</li><li>Dimensions: 20.25 x 13.5 x 9.25 inches (carry-on), 25 x 17.25 x 13 inches (checked bag)</li><li>Weight: 9 pounds (carry-on), 11.1 pounds (checked bag)</li><li>Material: Polycarbonate, aluminum</li><li>Expandable: Yes</li><li>Price on publish: $799.98</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Durable, high quality materials that are reliable and attractive</li><li>Charging functionality thanks to the built-in USB-A and C ports</li><li>Already capacious interior can also extend an additional two inches for larger packing loads</li><li>Several organizational features including a wet pocket</li><li>Limited lifetime warranty</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>No discount for buying as a set</li><li>Price tag is on the higher end of the range</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The TravelPro Platinum Elite Expandable Hardside Set offers a ton of storage space, additional expansion and smart functionality, in an attractive, durable package.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>TravelPro Platinum Elite Hardside Expandable 2-Piece Set</a></p><h3>Best large-capacity luggage set: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Delsey Paris Helium Aero Hardside Luggage Set</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best large-capacity luggage set</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/us.delsey.com/cdn/shop/products/delsey-helium-aero-0760311-01_720x.jpg alt="Delsey Paris Helium Aero Hardside Luggage Set" title="Delsey Paris Helium Aero Hardside Luggage Set" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Delsey Paris Helium Aero Hardside Luggage Set</h3></p><p>If you’re going to pay for a checked bag then it’s worth getting as much storage space as you can. While the overall size of a bag is a helpful guide to how much interior space there will be, different designs of suitcase will be able to fit different amounts, even if they share similar dimensions. For reliably spacious storage, I love the Delsey Paris Helium Aero Hardside Luggage, especially the larger 3-piece set. Each bag opens up to reveal two deep packing spaces, with minimal extra pockets to maximize the free space; if you have your own packing cubes, they will fit easily inside.</p><p>The suitcases come in several attractive colorways, so you can pick between classic neutrals or more vibrant jewel tones, and the variety of sizes ensures you’ll find the right fit for your various travel needs. Should you need additional room, there is also expandable functionality, on top of other details like TSA-approved locks, a one-button handle locking system, and soft-touch handles.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Number of pieces: 3</li><li>Dimensions: 21 x 14.5 x 10 inches (carry-on), 25 x 17.5 x 11.5 inches (small checked bag), 29 x 19.5 x 12.5 inches (large checked bag)</li><li>Weight: 6.82 pounds (carry-on), 10.2 pounds (small checked bag), 12.5 pounds (large checked bag)</li><li>Material: Polycarbonate</li><li>Expandable: Yes</li><li>Price on publish: $319.99 - $399.99 depending on the color</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Great storage volume, plus additional expansion capability</li><li>Affordable price point for three pieces of luggage</li><li>Attractive array of colors, not just the standard neutrals</li><li>All cases feature a built-in TSA-approved lock</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Minimal internal storage pockets for organization</li><li>Some customers report that the handle feels a bit loose</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>For maximum storage space at an affordable price, the Delsey Paris Helium Aero Hardside Luggage Set is a great choice that comes in several attractive colors.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Delsey Paris Helium Aero Hardside Luggage Set</a></p><h3>Most durable luggage set: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Samsonite Winfield 2 Hardside Luggage Set</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Most durable luggage set</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Samsonite Winfield 2 Hardside Luggage Set</h3></p><p>Modern travel involves luggage being thrown about, especially if you’re flying on a plane. Have peace of mind that your belongings will arrive safely with the Samsonite Winfield 2 Hardside Luggage Set. The durable polycarbonate material holds up well to rough handling thanks to its flexibility under pressure, while the unique brushed aesthetic helps to cover up any surface-level scuffs or scratches. This set also features three cases on the larger side, which is great for anyone traveling in a group or with a lot of belongings. Should you ever need more space, expandable capabilities add up to 1.5 inches of additional space.</p><p>Samsonite makes these bags in a range of fun colors, although not every color is readily available and some are priced a bit differently depending on inventory levels. However, if you’re open to a few colors, there will definitely be a set that is affordably priced and thoughtfully designed. All cases feature TSA-approved side-mounted locks and multidirectional wheels.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Number of pieces: 3</li><li>Dimensions: 20 x 13.5 x 9 inches (carry-on), 24 x 16.5 x 11 inches (small checked bag), 28 x 19 x 12 inches (large checked bag)</li><li>Weight: 6.7 pounds (carry-on), 9.3 pounds (small checked bag), 11.5 pounds (large checked bag)</li><li>Material: Polycarbonate</li><li>Expandable: Yes</li><li>Price on publish: $313.37 - $614.84 depending on the color</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Flexible polycarbonate that responds well to stress and keeps items protected</li><li>Side-mounted TSA locks for added security</li><li>Lots of bright colors and a brushed design to help hide any scuffs or scratches</li><li>Extra 1.5 inches expansion capacity and 360-degree multidirectional spinner wheels</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Different colorways have different availability</li><li>While it holds up well to drops and dents, the surface is easily scratched</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Trust that your suitcases will go the distance with the durable Samsonite Winfield 2 Hardside Luggage set, which features a unique brushed finish to disguise any scratches.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Samsonite Winfield 2 Hardside Luggage Set</a></p><h3>Best lightweight luggage set: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Delsey Paris Helium DTX Softside Luggage</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best lightweight luggage set</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Delsey Paris Helium DTX Softside Luggage</h3></p><p>Despite their large size, each of the three suitcases included in the Delsey Paris Helium DTX Softside Luggage set is noticeably lightweight—there’s a reason this collection is called Helium. The soft material is made of DuraTec, ensuring that the luggage can withstand all the rigors of travel while staying light and portable. When fully packed, these cases are still noticeably easy to handle and the Dual Density double-spinner wheels also mean you don’t need to use much force to glide them along the ground.</p><p>There are only two colors to choose from—black and navy—but the silhouette is sleek and stylish, even with the ability to expand an additional two inches. Security is a priority for Delsey Paris, with the cases featuring TSA locks and patented SecuriTech zips, for greater peace of mind when traveling. Inside you’ll find two shoe pockets, a mesh pocket, and a wet bag for easier organization. These aren’t the cheapest suitcases on this list, but the large sizes and durability mean that they will perform well year after year.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Number of pieces: 3</li><li>Dimensions:20 x 14.25 x 10 inches (carry-on), 25 x 17.75 x 12 inches (small checked bag), 29 x 20 x 13.5 inches (large checked bag)</li><li>Weight: 6.7 pounds (carry-on), 8.4 pounds (small checked bag), 10.2 pounds (large checked bag)</li><li>Material: DuraTec fabric</li><li>Expandable: Yes</li><li>Price on publish: $419.35 - $499.88 depending on the color</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Lightweight materials ensure easy portability even when fully packed</li><li>Large storage capacity, expandable functionality, and internal storage pockets</li><li>Sleek, expensive-looking design that doesn’t compromise on durability</li><li>Greater security thanks to TSA locks and SecuriTech zips</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Only two colors to choose from, both neutrals</li><li>Not as affordable as other luggage sets on the list</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The Delsey Paris Helium DTX Softside set is stylish, durable and surprisingly lightweight for its size, ensuring you can bring everything you need with ease.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Delsey Paris Helium DTX Softside Luggage</a></p><h3>Most stylish luggage set: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Monos For Your Special Someone Luggage Set</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Most stylish luggage set</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Monos For Your Special Someone Luggage Set</h3></p><p>These suitcases include all the performance details of their competitors—durable shell, 360-degree multidirectional spinner wheels, TSA locks, telescopic handle—but in a very sleek, minimalist design that prizes sustainability. The polycarbonate is partially made of recycled materials, while the leather accents are vegan, and the antimicrobial lining is 100% recycled polyester.</p><p>There is a core collection of colors in tasteful neutrals and earth tones, as well as a few limited edition shades depending on the season. With the luggage set, you can even choose a mix of colors for maximum style. Other thoughtful design choices include color-coordinated YKK reverse coil zippers for a seamless look and a built-in yet removable compression pad for maximum storage capacity. While some users reported that there was visible scuffing after extended use, Monos does include a cleaning sponge which is effective at removing those marks. Overall, this luggage set looks as good as it is sustainable.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Number of pieces: 2</li><li>Dimensions: 22 x 14 x 9 inches (carry-on), 26.5 x 18.5 x 10.5 inches (checked bag)</li><li>Weight: 7 pounds (carry-on), 9.59 pounds (checked bag)</li><li>Material: Partially-recycled polycarbonate</li><li>Expandable: No</li><li>Price on publish: $480</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Color choices are thoughtful, varied, and change seasonally</li><li>Silhouette is sleek and minimalist, yet still includes useful features like TSA locks, a compression pad, and spinner wheels</li><li>Materials are environmentally responsible, durable, and water-resistant</li><li>Price is reasonable for high-quality design and luxury materials</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>No expansion capabilities so not quite as capacious as other suitcases</li><li>Does scuff more easily than some other luggage, although a cleaning sponge is included</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Travel in refined style with a set of Monos luggage, which comes in a range of luxurious colors and features thoughtful details that deliver on performance and design.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Monos For Your Special Someone Luggage Set</a></p><h3>Best maneuverable luggage set: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Antler Stamford 2.0 Set</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best maneuverable luggage set</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Antler Stamford 2.0 Set</h3></p><p>A suitcase not only has to fit all your packing inside it, but it also needs to travel with you to your destination. Large suitcases can be tricky to maneuver if the luggage design is poor, which is why the Antler Stamford 2.0 Luggage Set stands so far apart from the competition. The Hinomoto 360-degree wheels feature Lisof tire fabric, which offers a muted tread and enhanced control so you can easily slide your luggage along any terrain. They’re also designed to be well-greased for longer, meaning they’ll have a lengthier lifespan. The polycarbonate shell is durable and lightweight for easy mobility, with a matte surface that helps hide any scratches.</p><p>For those who pack more heavily, there is an expander function in addition to the large interiors. There are also several organizational devices: three internal zipped pockets, a small zipped pouch for valuables, a mesh lid pocket, and branded compression straps. A stylish bonus? The hardware and components have been color matched for a cohesive look across all three bags.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Number of pieces: 3</li><li>Dimensions: 21.7 x 13.9 x 9.1 inches (carry-on), 26.8 x 18.9 x 11.6 inches (small checked bag), 32.1 x 21.3 x 13.6 inches (large checked bag)</li><li>Weight: 6.22 pounds (carry-on), 8.8 pounds (small checked bag), 11.29 pounds (large checked bag)</li><li>Material: Polycarbonate</li><li>Expandable: Yes</li><li>Price on publish: $868</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>The double whisper-quiet wheels which offer enhanced control and greater longevity</li><li>The polycarbonate shell balances lightness and durability</li><li>Wide array of internal pockets for easier organization</li><li>Lifetime warranty</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>More expensive than other options on this list</li><li>Only four colors available</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>For first-class maneuverability, look no further than Antler’s Stamford 2.0 Luggage set which features industry-leading Japanese wheels for unparalleled quiet control.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Antler Stamford 2.0 Set</a></p><h3>Best organization luggage set: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Away Suitcase Set of 2 Classic</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best organization luggage set</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets.awaytravel.com/spree/product_set_tile_images/47085/original/PDP_PC_Gloss_Salt_Collection_BCO-LRG.jpg alt="Away Suitcase Set of 2 Classic" title="Away Suitcase Set of 2 Classic" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Away Suitcase Set of 2 Classic</h3></p><p>The bigger the suitcase, the more risk there is of everything getting jumbled up inside. Fortunately, the Away Suitcase Set of 2 Classic features valuable yet unobtrusive storage features for easier organization. Each case has a zip-up mesh compartment, as well as the brand’s signature interior compression system to help maximize the storage capacity of each bag.</p><p>Away also includes a removable laundry bag with each suitcase, to help you separate your clean and dirty clothes during your travels. While the organization system is prized, the rest of the Away cases are also impressive: The exteriors are made of a lightweight, yet durable polycarbonate shell, there’s an easy-grip top handle, and the 360-degree multidirectional wheels make maneuvering simple. In terms of style, Away luggage is minimalist in shape yet brightly colored, with several different shades and limited edition colors throughout the year. These suitcases aren’t cheap, but by buying the set you save $50 off the list price.

Its Aviator Set Plus collection includes the Carry-On Plus and the Grand Checked Bag, both made from recycled polycarbonate with recycled aluminum handles, recycled vegan leather accents, and recycled zippers. Each purchase is then made carbon-neutral, with Paravel offsetting the carbon created from sourcing, assembly, shipping, delivery, and the customer’s first expected plane trip. Even the luggage lining is made from Negative Nylon, which recycles 36 plastic water bottles per suitcase.</p><p>With all this focus on sustainability, Paravel is still able to deliver on performance: the shell is aerospace-grade polycarbonate, the 360 degree spinner wheels have carbon steel bearings, and the interior includes a laundry bag and compression system.

While there are some great value sets of three to four pieces, it may not be worth buying—and storing—additional bags if you won’t get regular use out of them. Also be sure to check the dimensions of the suitcases, as there will be fluctuations in size between brands; some carry-ons measure 19 inches while others come in at 21 inches, so make sure you’re getting the size you need.</p><p>Consider the materials. Hardside luggage sets will usually be made of either ABS or 100% polycarbonate; ABS is cheaper but a little less durable, which may influence your choice. Softside luggage is usually surface-treated for durability and water resistance, but might require more intense cleaning than hardside sets, which can just be wiped down. However, in the long run, softside fabrics usually hold up better thanks to their greater flexibility. Finally, think about whether you want something that is eye-catching and easy to spot at baggage claim, or whether you want something more restrained and stylish. There’s something for everyone on this list.</p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-luggage-sets>How we selected the best luggage sets</h2><p>Luggage has to be functional both for storage and for transportation, so I made sure to assess all of these suitcases against a comprehensive list of criteria. Luggage sets were evaluated by price, material, storage capacity, maneuverability, durability, style, size, organizational features, and additional performance features. I looked into how the suitcases held up over time and whether certain elements, like wheels or handles, were prone to issue after extended use. I considered the opinions of industry experts, frequent travelers and everyday customers, as well as my own firsthand experience. I took into account that different travelers have different needs, from solo long-haulers to large families and everything in between. Ultimately, I only included luggage sets that met high standards of performance across the board.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-choosing-a-luggage-set>What to consider when choosing a luggage set</h2><h3>How much room do you need?</h3><p>Luggage sets can range in size, both in terms of the number of pieces in the set and in the size of each suitcase. The most frequent combinations are two-piece sets, consisting of a carry-on bag and a checked suitcase, and three-piece sets, which add a larger checked bag for greater versatility. Some <a rel=alternate href=#>luggage brands</a> also offer smaller or larger versions of each set, to accommodate different packing needs. If you frequently travel for longer periods of time, pack for more than one person, or simply like to bring more items with you, then you may want to choose a set with larger sized bags or additional pieces. You also may want to look for expandable suitcases that can adjust to accommodate a larger volume of items.</p><h3>Who will be using this set?</h3><p>If you’re buying a luggage set just for yourself, you only need to take into account your travel needs. However, if you are planning to share this set with a partner or with your family, you might need additional features or capacity. Families may want to look for luggage sets with three or four pieces to better accommodate each family member, while couples may want a customizable set that allows for two carry-ons and one checked bag. You can read more about <a rel=alternate href=#>carry-on luggage</a> in our guide.</p><p>If one person in the group travels often for business, they may need the option of a smart carry-on that supports USB charging. Families with young children may want to invest in durable bags that won’t show wear and tear as easily and that will last for years to come. By understanding who will be using the suitcases, you can better find a luggage set that works for everyone.</p><h3>What are your packing priorities?</h3><p>Each luggage set includes a different set of features, for different kinds of travelers. Some suitcases focus on style and design, while others emphasize durability and storage space. If you know you’ll be walking your suitcase for long distances then easy maneuverability will be key, while others may value organizational features like inner pockets and laundry bags. Some travelers want a minimalist, unobtrusive bag that won’t draw attention, while others want a vibrant color that they know they can spot at baggage claim. While all the luggage sets on this list scored highly across the board, there are some that are better suited to specific preferences, so keep in mind what your non-negotiables are.</p><h3>What is your budget?</h3><p>This list includes a range of pricing, with affordable sets under $100 and other sets coming in several hundred dollars higher. Larger sets will cost more than smaller sets, but pricing will also depend on the materials used, whether there are additional design features, and on the general styling of the set. Some travelers will want to get the most affordable option available, but others will be willing to spend more in exchange for a specific look or feature. Lifetime warranties and durability may impact the overall lifetime cost of the item; spending a bit more on a luggage set that lasts longer could save you money in the long run.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What usually comes in a luggage set?</h3><p>Most luggage sets consist of either two or three pieces of luggage: a carry-on bag and then either a medium or large checked bag (or both). While there are sets that focus on carry-on only, such as an upright wheelie bag and a separate personal item, I prioritized luggage sets that featured greater storage space. The luggage sets are usually standard in color, although a couple of brands let you mix and match colors within a set. It’s often possible to purchase additional products in the same collection, in addition to the luggage set, such as a second carry-on bag, a <a rel=alternate href=#>duffel bag</a> or a larger sized checked bag.</p><h3>What are the benefits of luggage sets?</h3><p>Buying luggage in a set (as opposed to individually) has a couple of key benefits. For one, brands usually offer a discounted price when you buy multiple items together; larger sets or more expensive sets can have savings worth hundreds of dollars. Another benefit is the luggage matches and share the same aesthetic if they’re purchased as a set. While you may be able to buy additional matching pieces at a later date, this could prove challenging if there is a lack of inventory or the brand changes its colorways. Lastly, buying a luggage set is a sure way to get several different pieces of luggage in complementary sizes, so you always have something to fit your packing needs.</p><h3>How many pieces should a luggage set have?</h3><p>This depends on your needs. If you’re a solo traveler or buying for one person, you will probably only need a two-piece luggage set consisting of a carry-on bag and a checked bag. Couples may want the option of a third matching piece, so both individuals can have a carry-on and they can share the checked bag. Families may be okay with three pieces or they may want to look for luggage sets that offer additional items. You can always customize your set and add on another piece of luggage, but the best discounts will come from official sets so look for brands that offer the number of suitcases that best suit your travel needs.</p><h3>Can you create your own set?</h3><p>Most brands will offer several different luggage combinations, including different size options and different color options. This enables you to find the mix of suitcases that best serves you, although it may not be possible to get exactly the combination you want if you’re looking for an unusual mix of items. Some brands let you build your own set by adding individual products to your basket, with the set discount being applied at checkout.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lnKq0qK3GnmSsnaSofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-voice-recap-the-blind-auditions-continue-with-a-shocking-four-chair-turn.html><span>←</span><span>The Blind Auditions Continue With A SHOCKING Four-Chair Turn</span></a>
