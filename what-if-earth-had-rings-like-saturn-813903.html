You try rebooting your phone, but there’s still no&nbsp;connection. Out of&nbsp;nowhere, your sister barges into your room in&nbsp;panic.</p><p>She’s screaming something about rings. Boxing rings? Wedding rings? Rings on&nbsp;the tub? She’s not making any sense. So&nbsp;she drags you out of&nbsp;the house and shows you the <a href=# title=sky data-link=tag>sky</a>. You take a&nbsp;look-up and see streaks of&nbsp;objects forming miles above the Earth’s surface.</p><p>Her connection seems to&nbsp;work. The two of&nbsp;you check online what’s going&nbsp;on, and everywhere the same thing is&nbsp;making headlines: Rings are suddenly appearing in&nbsp;our sky! #Earthrings is&nbsp;breaking the hashtag record and videos are going super viral. Your sister can’t help but join the crowd and takes a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;selfies with the sky.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/20b/107/84406d563bb04355f4521e1fb4.png><p>You run to&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV in&nbsp;your living room to&nbsp;check out the <a href=# title=news data-link=tag>news</a>. Scientists are warning about a&nbsp;coming catastrophe and explaining that everyone should remain indoors. Even though it’s a&nbsp;cloudless day in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;summer, the <a href=# title=weather data-link=tag>weather</a> seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;getting colder and colder.</p><p>Suddenly, the signal’s cut off. Other channels show nothing either. Then you see your neighbors packing their bags and heading out. Others follow suit. You hesitate a&nbsp;bit but decide to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the same in&nbsp;the end. Your sister is&nbsp;still outside taking selfies when you urge her to&nbsp;come along with you to&nbsp;seek some answers.</p><p>The two of&nbsp;you hop in&nbsp;your car and drive out into the city. The rings above seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;gaining more mass with each second. You and your sister are getting colder and colder. You head to&nbsp;the university to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;anyone knows anything, but there’s no&nbsp;one there. Only one parked car in&nbsp;the lot. And it’s a&nbsp;good thing you recognize that car.</p><p>You and your sister rush in&nbsp;and find the astronomy professor doing some quick calculations and trying to&nbsp;figure out why all this is&nbsp;happening. He&nbsp;urges you to&nbsp;take the seats and begins explaining. No&nbsp;one knows what this all is&nbsp;about, but it’s limiting the sun’s exposure on&nbsp;Earth. Which explains why it’s getting colder by&nbsp;the minute. Why the rings are getting thicker is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mystery too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/085/652/df24bd5eeb9554a2fa5b0740c6.png><p>On&nbsp;Saturn, the rings are made up&nbsp;of&nbsp;ice and rock particles. They can be&nbsp;as&nbsp;small as&nbsp;an&nbsp;ant or&nbsp;the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bus. The rocks could be&nbsp;leftover meteor debris or&nbsp;even remains of&nbsp;dwarf planets. But since Earth is&nbsp;so&nbsp;close to&nbsp;the Sun, ice wouldn’t be&nbsp;something you’d find floating above&nbsp;us. With all these rocks piled&nbsp;up, they block the Earth’s access to&nbsp;the Sun to&nbsp;warm&nbsp;us up&nbsp;and give&nbsp;us light.</p><p>The professor goes on&nbsp;to&nbsp;explain that Earth will enter a&nbsp;new Ice Age and oxygen levels will deplete within a&nbsp;year’s time unless those newborn rings disappear anytime soon. This also explains why there’s no&nbsp;connection; the rocks that form the rings are hitting and breaking the satellites.</p><p>Suddenly, you hear a&nbsp;loud ringing noise outside. The three of&nbsp;you head outside and see a&nbsp;helicopter blasting an&nbsp;alarm with a&nbsp;red light flashing. “Everyone to&nbsp;your homes now! This is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;drill! Everyone, head home!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8fc/86b/5c7c3758429a54afd75cfb02c6.png><p>You get in&nbsp;your car with your sister, but the roads are jammed. You have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;foot which will take 2&nbsp;hours. There’s no&nbsp;way anyone can remain outdoors. You venture out seeing everyone stuck on&nbsp;the road. They’re all arguing with each other and causing chaos. You try not to&nbsp;get caught in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;anything and sneak your way to&nbsp;the highway.</p><p>With the rings getting thicker, less sunlight is&nbsp;breaking through. This Ice Age info is&nbsp;stuck in&nbsp;your head, chilling you even more. You take a&nbsp;deep breath and see a&nbsp;thin mist coming out of&nbsp;your mouth. The sky is&nbsp;getting darker, and you’re still not home yet.</p><p>Your sister is&nbsp;tired and needs to&nbsp;rest, but you urge her to&nbsp;move&nbsp;on. You find an&nbsp;abandoned clothes shop and head inside. The store clerks are actually giving away thick jackets for everyone to&nbsp;wear. You grab a&nbsp;couple and slip them&nbsp;on.</p><p>Only 1&nbsp;more hour to&nbsp;get home, but the sky is&nbsp;completely dark. There’s no&nbsp;way you and your sister can go&nbsp;out in&nbsp;such conditions. So&nbsp;you decide to&nbsp;camp up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the clothes shop. They set up&nbsp;a&nbsp;mini bonfire in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the shop and create makeshift sleeping bags with the rest of&nbsp;the unused clothes. Luckily, there’s enough <a href=# title=food data-link=tag>food</a> to&nbsp;feed everyone including you and your sister.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6c7/f6f/9588425dab83140d026838f9a3.png><p>It’s the middle of&nbsp;the night. The fire goes out, and you can’t see outside the shop. You head to&nbsp;the window and open it&nbsp;up. A&nbsp;huge pile of&nbsp;snow spills in&nbsp;and wakes everyone&nbsp;up. It’s the middle of&nbsp;August and a&nbsp;snowstorm formed overnight. Everyone is&nbsp;freezing and start the fire anew. There’s no&nbsp;radio or&nbsp;any way to&nbsp;find out what’s happening.</p><p>The wind picks up&nbsp;and starts shaking the shop. Things start falling off the shelves but you and everyone else are cozy by&nbsp;the fire. The next day you look outside and see the entire area covered in&nbsp;snow. You live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;sunny place where it&nbsp;barely rains. And the rings in&nbsp;the outer atmosphere are even bigger than last night.</p><p>Out of&nbsp;nowhere, a&nbsp;truck filled with people pulls over and the driver tells you there’s a&nbsp;shelter for everyone some miles away. The truck has chains all over the tires and is&nbsp;equipped for the worst snowy conditions. Even though it’s morning, the sky is&nbsp;pretty dark. You and everyone else hop&nbsp;in.</p><p>Abandoned cars, some with their doors still open, are scattered all over. The truck drives around them, or&nbsp;just smashes through the ones in&nbsp;the way. It&nbsp;pulls over next to&nbsp;an&nbsp;ambulance and takes all the equipment to&nbsp;help the ones in&nbsp;need.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2c1/b04/355e8b54a59de089852149ff69.png><p>You drive past your neighborhood and see your entire house covered in&nbsp;snow. The large <a href=# title=tree data-link=tag>tree</a> in&nbsp;your backyard has fallen under the weight of&nbsp;the snow and broken the roof, allowing snow to&nbsp;flood&nbsp;in. The truck speeds through and gets to&nbsp;the shelter, which, to&nbsp;your surprise, is&nbsp;the mall.</p><p>You get out and see many of&nbsp;the townspeople being led to&nbsp;various stores that have now turned into dorms and health units. You’re left in&nbsp;a&nbsp;sports store with a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;other people. Your sister has also been able to&nbsp;bunk with you. And to&nbsp;your luck, you see the professor helping out some people.</p><p>But shortly after that, a&nbsp;loud explosion blasts through the mall and shatters glass screens. Everyone ducks for cover. You see people running outside. You head out and see a&nbsp;large metallic object lying in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the mall entrance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/960/b60/5f563258628bc3506892d08038.png><p>There are people crowding the entire area, so&nbsp;it’s not easy to&nbsp;see what all the fuss is&nbsp;about. But after getting a&nbsp;closer look, you find out it’s a&nbsp;satellite fallen from orbit. It&nbsp;crashed in&nbsp;the front yard and made the boom.</p><p>There were also reports of&nbsp;other satellites crashing on&nbsp;Earth in&nbsp;the most random places. That means all communication has been wiped out of&nbsp;the map. You run back inside the mall to&nbsp;await what happens next. You look at&nbsp;your sister in&nbsp;fear not knowing that the new Ice Age has just begun.</p><p>1&nbsp;year later. You’re relaxing in&nbsp;your bunker when your sister barges&nbsp;in, freaking out. The rings are still there, but it’s something else now. You run outside and see everyone gathering round and looking at&nbsp;the sky. Within a&nbsp;year, temperatures have dropped to&nbsp;freeze the entirety of&nbsp;the Earth’s surface.</p><p>Deserts and tropical jungles have turned into icy wastelands. More than half of&nbsp;the wildlife went extinct and trees are as&nbsp;rare as&nbsp;a&nbsp;4-leaf clover. Which means oxygen levels have dropped significantly. Most of&nbsp;the population, or&nbsp;what’s remaining of&nbsp;it, live with oxygen tanks, with scientists still trying to&nbsp;crack the case of&nbsp;the rings. Exactly what the professor predicted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b29/1ad/9ceb495154823712e5d17d21f3.png><p>But up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the sky, rocks seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;falling down and crashing all over. It&nbsp;starts off far away, but then the rocks begin to&nbsp;fall down close&nbsp;by. You and everyone else run back to&nbsp;the mall, which has been covered with a&nbsp;layer of&nbsp;metal to&nbsp;keep the warmth inside. It&nbsp;should be&nbsp;pretty safe in&nbsp;there.</p><p>If&nbsp;the rocks are falling down, that means the rings are dissipating. Suddenly, you’re full of&nbsp;hope that the Ice Age might be&nbsp;over soon.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmoJ9llZa%2FtbSMoZidZaKeu6i%2FjKWgpJ1dqK61wdGnZHFpY259dHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./circulaires-et-commentaires-une-foule-de-ressources-utiles-accessibles-sur-le-net.html><span>←</span><span>une foule de ressources utiles accessibles sur le net</span></a>
