Though these philosophies are quite popular even outside of&nbsp;Northern Europe, in&nbsp;reality, for a&nbsp;good life you only need a&nbsp;little bit more than a&nbsp;cup of&nbsp;hot tea and a&nbsp;fireplace. Despite the harsh climate, Scandinavians <a href=#>have</a> a&nbsp;fairly long life expectancy and are mostly in&nbsp;good <a href=# title=health data-link=tag>health</a>.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> decided to&nbsp;find out about the good <a href=# title=lifestyle data-link=tag>lifestyle</a> habits that Scandinavians practice to&nbsp;help them be&nbsp;healthy and happy.</p><p><h2>Skiing instead of&nbsp;going to&nbsp;the gym</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d12/12f/dc1cda5bfd93e8a44808631c45.jpg><p>Even though most Norwegians live in&nbsp;cities now, being in&nbsp;<a href=# title=nature data-link=tag>nature</a> is&nbsp;<a href=#>still</a> a&nbsp;very important part of&nbsp;the local culture. Norwegians believe that it’s necessary to&nbsp;spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time outside and they even have a&nbsp;special word for it&nbsp;— <a href=#>friluftsliv</a>. <strong>Physical activity, for them, is&nbsp;not just a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;burn calories but also a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;experience some pleasure</strong>. This is&nbsp;why instead of&nbsp;going to&nbsp;the <a href=# title=gym data-link=tag>gym</a>, they go&nbsp;skiing, ice skating, for a&nbsp;swim in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lake, or&nbsp;for a&nbsp;walk in&nbsp;the forest. Find something you like (walking, dancing, yoga, football, or&nbsp;mountain climbing) and make it&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;your schedule. Besides, Scandinavians move a&nbsp;lot in&nbsp;their everyday lives: they walk, ride bikes to&nbsp;work, and clean up&nbsp;the snow near their houses.</p><p><h2>Butter is&nbsp;better than oil.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/39f/910/3f182a5fc3a4a8f585f7c48279.jpg><p>Scandinavians are sure that good butter is&nbsp;far better than oil or&nbsp;margarine. They <a href=#>add</a> a&nbsp;small piece of&nbsp;butter to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;meals, be&nbsp;it&nbsp;soup, meat, or&nbsp;vegetables. This makes the food more nuanced and more nutritious. By&nbsp;the way, Scandinavian studies have <a href=#>proven</a> that eating a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;milk fat decreases the risk of&nbsp;obesity.</p><p><h2>“There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;bad weather, only inappropriate clothing!”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d2/c4c/a31ed35d81a64e0dd2bd271fb5.jpg><p>It&nbsp;might seem that living in&nbsp;Norway or&nbsp;Sweden is&nbsp;a&nbsp;challenge: in&nbsp;winter, most of&nbsp;the territory is&nbsp;covered in&nbsp;snow and ice. The cold climate may not only bring discomfort but quite the opposite. Norwegians even have a&nbsp;<a href=#>proverb</a>&nbsp;— “There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;bad <a href=# title=weather data-link=tag>weather</a>, only inappropriate clothing!” which means that even in&nbsp;rainy or&nbsp;snowy weather you will see people riding bikes.</p><p>Low temperatures <a href=#>speed</a> up&nbsp;the metabolism, improve the quality of&nbsp;sleep, and regulate the appetite. Of&nbsp;course, the cold alone can’t make the body super-healthy, so&nbsp;it’s important to&nbsp;combine several good habits. Swedish model Karin Agstam, for example, <a href=#>starts</a> her day by&nbsp;showering in&nbsp;ice-cold water.</p><p><h2>Sweets for kids&nbsp;— only on&nbsp;Saturdays</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f9b/af5/31f95553e883f70cb043d96d2d.jpg><p>In&nbsp;<a href=#>Swedish</a> kindergartens, they don’t use sugar to&nbsp;cook meals. Besides, children don’t usually eat sweets before the age of&nbsp;2-3. But even when <a href=# title=kids data-link=tag>kids</a> grow&nbsp;up, they only get sweets on&nbsp;holidays and <a href=#>Saturdays</a> (which in&nbsp;Sweden are the days when people eat candy). <strong>Some of&nbsp;the most popular sweets for Scandinavians are salty licorice sweets</strong>. They don’t contain much sugar and they are much better than the chocolate bars we&nbsp;often eat.</p><p><h2>Lunches are bigger than dinners.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d29/a32/79991550ceb7c7d56134a72c33.jpg><p>In&nbsp;Sweden and Norway, lunchtime is&nbsp;called <a href=#>middag</a>. This is&nbsp;the time when people eat the most food during the day. They don’t have lunch midday like we&nbsp;do, but at&nbsp;about 4&nbsp;pm. A&nbsp;typical lunch is&nbsp;potatoes, meat, fish&nbsp;— foods that are rich in&nbsp;protein and carbohydrates. And for dinner, people in&nbsp;Scandinavian countries prefer lighter meals, like those they eat for <a href=#>breakfast</a>: fish sandwiches, vegetables or&nbsp;cheese, yogurt, muesli. So, they don’t go&nbsp;to&nbsp;bed full and the stomach doesn’t have to&nbsp;digest heavy foods during the night.</p><p><h2>Using the sauna is&nbsp;the best beauty procedure.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ef/4c7/76ff9b50adb471e73059c631a4.jpg><p>After long walks in&nbsp;the cold, of&nbsp;course, the first thing you want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;get warm. Scandinavians really love saunas. For them, it’s part of&nbsp;their culture, and inviting someone to&nbsp;the sauna means showing respect for them. This is&nbsp;probably another <a href=#>secret</a> that explains why Scandinavians are so&nbsp;healthy. Also, visiting the sauna is&nbsp;always on&nbsp;the list of&nbsp;beauty procedures for Scandinavian women&nbsp;— this is&nbsp;how their skin remains so&nbsp;shiny and clean.</p><p><h2>You don’t need a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;products to&nbsp;keep the skin beautiful.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fc7/8a2/70f038553f8b0951eb7bd0d20e.jpg><p>Strong winter winds are a&nbsp;big challenge for the soft skin of&nbsp;the face. This is&nbsp;why the most important part of&nbsp;skincare in&nbsp;Scandinavia is&nbsp;moisturizing. For example, a&nbsp;beauty product <a href=#>expert</a> says that during the winter, she only uses a&nbsp;cleansing oil for the face that helps to&nbsp;keep the skin moisturized. Unlike, the <a href=#>Asian</a> beauty standards, where there are multi-step skincare systems, Scandinavian women prefer the most basic products. You are <a href=#>not very likely</a> to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;woman that uses more than 3&nbsp;facial beauty products a&nbsp;day.</p><p><h2>The Scandinavian diet is&nbsp;the secret to&nbsp;a&nbsp;fit body.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/940/5fe/58b8f8535e8de2b15896f85818.jpg><p>Most Scandinavians prefer cooking at&nbsp;home, and they rarely go&nbsp;to&nbsp;restaurants. Their everyday <a href=#>diets</a>, along with their active lifestyle, allow them to&nbsp;keep their body healthy and looking good. People in&nbsp;Scandinavian countries regularly eat red fish that are rich in&nbsp;vitamin&nbsp;D and omega-3, a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;vegetables, and berries. And they don’t eat much red meat.</p><p><h2>Coffee breaks are sacred.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af5/ab8/e1e99b5c5f8f3c1839da5342c1.jpg><p>The Swedish people have the <a href=#>word</a> fika, which can be&nbsp;translated as&nbsp;“a&nbsp;break for coffee and a&nbsp;cookie” but in&nbsp;reality, it&nbsp;means more than that. This is&nbsp;the time when you are distracted from your routine (your work, your devices) and you drink coffee with your friends. Fika is&nbsp;not just a&nbsp;coffee break, it’s a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;slow down time and think about the good stuff. While other countries have coffee breaks that are just as&nbsp;fast as&nbsp;their life itself, where people grab their paper cups to&nbsp;go&nbsp;and keep running, in&nbsp;Sweden coffee breaks are <a href=#>sacred</a>. They are sure that they should have fika every day because it’s a&nbsp;way for the brain to&nbsp;reload and rest from stress.</p><p><h2>Whole wheat bread instead of&nbsp;white bread</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/807/f53/0fe5a157dabe19b26d502d54b7.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the supermarkets of&nbsp;Northern Europe, it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;really hard to&nbsp;find white <a href=#>bread</a>. In&nbsp;Scandinavian countries, people have been eating whole wheat bread for many years: in&nbsp;the 18th-19th centuries bread was the main food for peasant families, and barley, oats, and rye were really <a href=#>popular</a>. White bread appeared much <a href=#>later</a>. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;sold in&nbsp;stores today, but Scandinavian people <a href=#>love</a> the whole wheat bread that is&nbsp;definitely <a href=#>better</a> for their health.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, we&nbsp;can’t say that every person in&nbsp;Denmark, Sweden, or&nbsp;Norway follows these rules with no&nbsp;exceptions. Of&nbsp;course, there are Swedes that don’t like coffee or&nbsp;Norwegians that prefer pizza instead of&nbsp;dinner at&nbsp;home.</p><p>Would you like to&nbsp;adopt some of&nbsp;these good Scandinavian habits or&nbsp;do&nbsp;you have your own habits to&nbsp;share?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xecaopp1lo5iur7DIp5ivoZGjeqmtwaKrrGWkna61ecqenKllpJ2yrnnHnpilrJiueqK6w2aYrayilrC1tdWeZHBxaWyDens%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./american-idol-season-22-is-filming-in-hawaii-guest-mentors-announced.html><span>←</span><span>'American Idol' Season 22 Is Filming in Hawaii, Guest Mentors Announced</span></a>
