It&nbsp;is&nbsp;nice to&nbsp;hear that there are people who protect others and help the poor, like the person who gave away their 3-bedroom house, just to&nbsp;make someone else’s life easier.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> are always inspired by&nbsp;new heroes and believe in&nbsp;miracles, especially during Christmas time.</p><p><h2>1. A&nbsp;man donated boots that he&nbsp;got by&nbsp;luck.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/98e/2a8/1d17625a9b9779f95ebde8ebba.jpg><p>A&nbsp;<a href=#>Reddit</a> user shared a&nbsp;story about his luck. He&nbsp;ordered one pair of&nbsp;Timberland shoes, but there was a&nbsp;mistake and they sent him 11&nbsp;pairs.</p><p>Instead of&nbsp;returning them back to&nbsp;the company, he&nbsp;donated the shoes to&nbsp;help refugees in&nbsp;Toronto. After his post on&nbsp;Reddit, the company just let him keep them for free. And you can see the police officers in&nbsp;the pic who helped the guy carry all the boots.</p><p><h2>2. Some people donated their kidney to&nbsp;save another person’s life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/061/6d1/b1bd1c54e089814125cc1812f0.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;act of&nbsp;kindness to&nbsp;donate clothes, food, or&nbsp;equipment, but there are some brave people like this woman, who decided to&nbsp;change someone’s whole life for the better.</p><p>In&nbsp;the picture, you can see the girl who decided to&nbsp;<a href=#>donate the kidney</a>. Her husband took a&nbsp;photo of&nbsp;her before the operation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/62d/005/9355b2561a97b4ff2accc9c3fb.jpg><p>Another brave <a href=#>woman</a> shared the first photo together with her boyfriend since surgery. She donated a&nbsp;kidney to&nbsp;him. This act of&nbsp;love is&nbsp;priceless.</p><p><h2>3. A&nbsp;hairdresser gives free haircuts to&nbsp;homeless people.</h2></p><p>“Do&nbsp;something for nothing” aren’t just words, but part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;campaign founded by&nbsp;British hairdresser Josh Coombes. He&nbsp;says that he&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;inspire people, and according to&nbsp;his <a href=#>Instagram</a> page, his mission has been successful.</p><p>Coombes encourages people to&nbsp;do&nbsp;small acts of&nbsp;kindness. It&nbsp;can even be&nbsp;a&nbsp;simple hello, but it’s better than ignoring the homeless, which makes them feel invisible and furthers their suffering.</p><p><h2>4. Rob Greenfield inspires people to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;healthy Earth.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d9/50c/1f06765dc7a6c21c87582bc3f8.jpg><p><a href=#>Rob Greenfield</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;writer, traveler, and environmental activist. With his lifestyle, he&nbsp;inspires people to&nbsp;live healthy lives and to&nbsp;not pollute our planet.</p><p>In&nbsp;2013, Greenfield traveled 4,700 miles (7,600&nbsp;km) across America on&nbsp;a&nbsp;bamboo bicycle. On&nbsp;this ride that took 104&nbsp;days, he&nbsp;used 610 liters of&nbsp;water and created just 2&nbsp;pounds (0.9&nbsp;kg) of&nbsp;trash. His goal was to&nbsp;push Americans to&nbsp;live more reasonably.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bc2/9be/674f485b8e85218126cff5f1ba.jpg><p>Also, Robert spent a&nbsp;year only bathing in&nbsp;lakes, rivers, and waterfalls. He&nbsp;continues to&nbsp;make people pay attention to&nbsp;things we&nbsp;consume every day, like water, energy, and food.</p><p><h2>5. A&nbsp;British entrepreneur donated a&nbsp;3-bedroom house.</h2></p><p><a href=#>Marco Robinson</a> knows firsthand what it&nbsp;means to&nbsp;be&nbsp;without a&nbsp;home. His mother struggled to&nbsp;pay rent and was homeless in&nbsp;Derbyshire and London. Years have passed and now he&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-made millionaire who has decided to&nbsp;help the poor.</p><p>Marco has about £25 million and decided to&nbsp;give away a&nbsp;flat in&nbsp;Preston which cost £120,000. As&nbsp;he&nbsp;<a href=#>said</a>: “I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;give back.”</p><p><h2>6. A&nbsp;Street Vet team helps street animals.</h2></p><p>This is&nbsp;Marley, she got a&nbsp;nice coat from <a href=#>Street Vet</a>.</p><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;nice to&nbsp;know that there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;vet clinic in&nbsp;the&nbsp;UK that provides free services for the pets of&nbsp;homeless people. Thanks to&nbsp;Sam Joseph and Jade Statt their idea to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;these pets became a&nbsp;reality, because sometimes a&nbsp;simple x-ray can cost a&nbsp;fortune.</p><p><h2>6. A&nbsp;barbershop helps abusive men to&nbsp;manage their traumatic past.</h2></p><p>“She is&nbsp;not your rehab,” This is&nbsp;the name of&nbsp;a&nbsp;movement against domestic violence. <a href=#>Barbershops</a> have been known as&nbsp;a&nbsp;place where men come to&nbsp;heal their souls through honest conversations.</p><p>Owner Matt Brown <a href=#>says</a> that his place has become a&nbsp;safe space where men can open&nbsp;up. It&nbsp;helps them to&nbsp;not transmit pain to&nbsp;someone else. And some women have even started seeing changes in&nbsp;their partners.</p><p><h2>7. People donate their hair to&nbsp;make someone else happy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eac/fe3/9cb27d5476ba2763011a98383a.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;random act of&nbsp;kindness, but for some people, it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;very important. People donate their hair to&nbsp;make people who suffer because of&nbsp;hair loss, happier.</p><p>This<a href=#> Reddit user</a> grew out his hair for 2&nbsp;and a&nbsp;half years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b2e/e8c/8f7e8852dc9ed5782d4096285b.jpg><p><a href=#>This guy</a> grew out his hair to&nbsp;donate it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the cancer society. After shaving, he&nbsp;got a&nbsp;cool hairstyle and leveled up&nbsp;his karma.</p><p>Has anyone ever done something nice for you when you least expected&nbsp;it? Have you ever taken part in&nbsp;charity?
