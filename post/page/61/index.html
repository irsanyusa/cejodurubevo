SITTING ON A BALE OF BARLEY destined for his cattle, Dick Carver gets just a little misty eyed as he recalls the moment that propelled him to leadership of a rebellion now sweeping the West.

Dolly, who was born in the US state of Tennessee, has been delving into her heritage as part of a documentary, which, according to her niece, has found the country superstar’s lineage can be traced back to Conwy in North Wales.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Global Backlash Made Qatar Treat Migrant Workers Better</h2><time>Jul 2, 2024</time>

Many things have changed since Jahurul Mohammed first came to Qatar eight years ago. For one, the colossal Al Bayt Stadium, which hosted the2022 World Cup opening ceremony, didn’t exist, and the only thing other than sand dunes in its vicinity 30 miles north of Doha was a famous wedding hall. “None of this was here,” says Mohammed, a taxi driver from Bangladesh, sweeping his hand across the dazzling cityscape of concrete and neon beyond his windshield.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Kings of Leon Sign With Capitol Records, Announce New Album and Tour</h2><time>Jul 2, 2024</time>

The Mariana Trench in&nbsp;the western Pacific Ocean is&nbsp;the deepest place on&nbsp;our planet. If&nbsp;you throw a&nbsp;rock into the water, it’ll travel 36,000 feet [(11,000&nbsp;M)] before touching the bottom. But unlike your body, the rock won’t experience any unpleasant consequences.

But then, what would happen to&nbsp;your body at&nbsp;the very bottom of&nbsp;the Mariana Trench?
