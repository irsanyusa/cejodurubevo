It&nbsp;is&nbsp;considered a&nbsp;<a href=# title=supernatural data-link=tag>supernatural</a> <a href=# title=comedy data-link=tag>comedy</a> show, and her character portrays this dark girl with psychic abilities. She is&nbsp;sent to&nbsp;Nevermore Academy for causing chaos at&nbsp;other schools.</p><p>As&nbsp;dark as&nbsp;her character may&nbsp;be, Jenna revealed that she finds many similarities between herself and her character. “I&nbsp;love things that are a&nbsp;bit off-putting, things when, the closer you look, really aren’t that pretty. I&nbsp;love things that are <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>disturbing</a>.” She describes herself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“weirdo.”</p><p><h2>2. Adam Sandler in&nbsp;almost all of&nbsp;his movies.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/719/63e/d1057952b197a70414bc150089.jpg><p>Adam has practically made a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>career</a> of&nbsp;playing an&nbsp;ordinary, regular, uncomplicated guy. He&nbsp;was very committed to&nbsp;being a&nbsp;comedian, and as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;his dreams came true, he&nbsp;became okay with playing ordinary, average guys. He&nbsp;aims to&nbsp;make people laugh.</p><p>“My&nbsp;name is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Adam</a> Sandler. I’m not particularly talented. I’m not particularly good-looking. And yet I’m a&nbsp;multi-millionaire.”</p><h2>3. Matthew Perry as&nbsp;Chandler Bing in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Friends</i></a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/800/501/02d0735712b2dfd85ffc76f2f5.jpg><p>Many scenes in&nbsp;the famous&nbsp;TV show <i><a href=# title=Friends data-link=tag>Friends</a></i> are unscripted, and Matthew Perry surely knows how to&nbsp;improvise, so&nbsp;really he&nbsp;was just being himself. In&nbsp;real life, Matthew is&nbsp;very <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sarcastic</a> and witty, and so&nbsp;is&nbsp;his character Chandler.</p><p>There was one scene where he&nbsp;just went along with the script, but ad-libbed a&nbsp;little at&nbsp;the end. <i>Friends</i> was mostly shot in&nbsp;just a&nbsp;few locations&nbsp;— besides the 2&nbsp;apartments, they would always go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the fictional Central Perk Cafe. And in&nbsp;the series finale, when Rachel suggested to&nbsp;the group that they should go&nbsp;grab a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>coffee</a>, he&nbsp;replied, “Sure, where?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c30/fb7/1e2ce3586a9d9a515bb194d5ec.jpg><p>At&nbsp;first, Emma thought her character, Hermione, was quite different from how she was in&nbsp;real life. “I’m not like Hermione. I’m into fashion, and I’m much cooler than she&nbsp;is. And then&nbsp;I came to&nbsp;a&nbsp;place of&nbsp;acceptance. Actually, we&nbsp;do&nbsp;have a&nbsp;lot in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>common</a>. There are obviously differences, but there are a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;ways that I’m very similar<i>.</i> And I&nbsp;stopped fighting that!”</p><p>They are both passionate about social welfare, they’re genius, love books, homeschool themselves, are loyal friends, and surprisingly enough, their parents aren’t wizards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5fc/487/6c60245c7290e50a37591a0203.jpg><p>In&nbsp;<i>The Office</i>, Jenna’s character Pam is&nbsp;a&nbsp;receptionist. She revealed that there are definitely some differences between her and Pam, but there is&nbsp;one area where they share common ground. Although Pam is&nbsp;less ambitious and less <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>motivated</a>, they both needed to&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;speak up&nbsp;for themselves.</p><p>“I&nbsp;literally sat at&nbsp;reception desks and daydreamed about the day that&nbsp;I might be&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor.” Just like Jenna, Pam had always dreamed of&nbsp;having the freedom to&nbsp;convey her artistic abilities.</p><h2>6. Robert Downey&nbsp;Jr.&nbsp;as&nbsp;Tony Stark in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Iron Man</i></a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/81b/25e/328acd525391391a7a4657c1c5.jpg><p>Robert Downey&nbsp;Jr. says he&nbsp;can relate to&nbsp;his character, Tony. “I&nbsp;could relate to&nbsp;<a href=# title="Tony Stark" data-link=tag>Tony Stark</a> a&nbsp;lot by&nbsp;the time&nbsp;I played him. A&nbsp;guy who really needed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;handed a&nbsp;dose of&nbsp;ouch.” In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, Robert revealed how his moral <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>psychology</a>, “which doesn’t count for much,” and will to&nbsp;“do&nbsp;the right thing” made his return to&nbsp;the role.</p><p>“Whenever you get handed a&nbsp;true period of&nbsp;humiliation. I’ll speak to&nbsp;my&nbsp;own experience seeing it&nbsp;with other people, I&nbsp;give them credit for dusting themselves off. I&nbsp;hate to&nbsp;say it&nbsp;— but it’s a&nbsp;very American thing to&nbsp;build&nbsp;up, break down, and come back.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ff/272/d53d0158c0b47bed7f32127860.jpg><p>Amanda says that she can relate to&nbsp;Sophie very much in&nbsp;<i>Mamma Mia!</i> “I&nbsp;mean, they’re both versions of&nbsp;me. She’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>impulsive</a> and scatterbrained and doesn’t really know who she is&nbsp;yet, but is&nbsp;willing to&nbsp;try and find out.”</p><p>However, in&nbsp;the next movie, <i>Mamma Mia, Here We&nbsp;Go&nbsp;Again!</i>, she doesn’t see many similarities in&nbsp;that version of&nbsp;Sophie. “She kind of&nbsp;knows who she&nbsp;is, maybe not what<i> </i>she wants, but sort of&nbsp;what she wants. And she’s doing what she loves to&nbsp;do, and she’s fearless.”</p><h2>8. Ryan Reynolds as&nbsp;Wade Wilson in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Deadpool</i></a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/44e/bac/24a4cc5b4ba0c9fe1f3e118896.jpg><p>There are plenty of&nbsp;similarities between Ryan and Wade in&nbsp;<i>Deadpool</i>. Ryan is&nbsp;a&nbsp;pretty funny guy in&nbsp;real life, and his comedy is&nbsp;all about drawing out <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sentences</a>, as&nbsp;Wade does. They are both known for joking around in&nbsp;tense circumstances and are from the same country.</p><p>Ryan and Scarlett Johansson were once married, and she is&nbsp;the <i>Black Widow</i> who dated Wade. So, they even had the same girl. They also both like to&nbsp;make fun of&nbsp;themselves and often mock themselves.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these actors did you think were completely different in&nbsp;real life and on-screen? Why?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIVurcKtpqurXay1sHnAq5xmq59iwKq5yKWYq2WkpHq1tMSiqWaemZjBqrvNmqNmm5iWv6Kv056prGWknbK6eceam2amn2K9s7vBpZymZaSWuKq6xmaroZ1dpa6zwIxxaGlsZW18</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sytycd-winner-alexis-warr-burton-joins-dwts-season-31-troupe.html><span>←</span><span>'SYTYCD' Winner Alexis Warr Burton Joins 'DWTS' Season 31 Troupe</span></a>
