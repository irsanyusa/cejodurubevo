And today we&nbsp;even have <strong>folding bikes</strong> that make it&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;move around, especially going to&nbsp;work or&nbsp;traveling because they can easily fit inside your car.</p><p>With so&nbsp;many options out there, we&nbsp;chose the <strong>best folding bikes</strong> from Amazon. Continue reading as&nbsp;we&nbsp;prepared 12&nbsp;practical accessories that can fit any bike.</p><p><h2>How to&nbsp;choose the right folding bike</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a58/986/760a4c53469ba14d182fe13851.jpg><p>While folding bikes are really convenient and practical, getting one means trading off the cycling performance that regular bikes provide. But this doesn’t mean that all folded bikes are not suitable for long rides, in&nbsp;fact, there are a&nbsp;few main features that will help you decide what type of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>foldable bike</a> you need.</p><ul><li><strong>Folding size&nbsp;</strong>— Any folding size can be&nbsp;easily fitted in&nbsp;your car and even public transport. But a&nbsp;bigger folding size means the bike is&nbsp;better for longer cycling distances, while the smaller ones are better for short distances like going to&nbsp;work or&nbsp;school.</li><li><strong>Folding speed</strong>&nbsp;— This is&nbsp;an&nbsp;important feature only if&nbsp;you plan to&nbsp;fold and unfold your bike a&nbsp;few times a&nbsp;day. The faster ones will take about 10&nbsp;seconds to&nbsp;fold, while others might take as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;10&nbsp;minutes.</li><li><strong>Wheel size</strong>&nbsp;— Usually, a&nbsp;good foldable bike has about 50&nbsp;cm wheel size and&nbsp;up. But remember that for short distant rides it’s better to&nbsp;get one with smaller wheels, while for longer distances get a&nbsp;bike with bigger wheels.</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>&nbsp;— While weight is&nbsp;not that important for touring, lightweight is&nbsp;always preferable.</li><li><strong>Gear system&nbsp;</strong>—<strong> </strong>The speeds available in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bike will determine how much force you need to&nbsp;use to&nbsp;spin the paddles, and how fast you’ll go.</li><li><strong>Carrying luggage</strong>&nbsp;— Maybe it’s not a&nbsp;feature that boosts performance, but it’s definitely more practical for running errands.</li></ul><p><h2>1.
