Because I’m a <a href=#>feminist</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Under A Pole Star</a>, my third book, is a novel about late 19th century arctic explorers that features, alongside ice, ambition and rivalry, more than one sexual relationship. And there’s a lot of detail. My central characters fall in love, and yes, they have a lot of sex. I was nervous about how the passages would be received. One Amazon reviewer has already <a href=# rel=noopener>complained</a> about “copious quantities of copulation.” The specter of the Literary Review’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bad </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sex Award</a>, given annually to authors of “poorly written, perfunctory or redundant passages of sexual description in modern fiction,” hovers over us all, tittering. Some judge writing explicitly about sex to be less than literary — or worse, discrediting of <a href=#>female characters.</a> But why should achieving romantic and sexual satisfaction — one of the most <a href=# rel=noopener>difficult challenges</a> we face as humans — be redacted or blurred?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There’s a problem with leaving “it” up to the reader’s imagination: Every reader will fill your tasteful ellipsis with something different — possibly with unachievable fantasy, with prejudices, with bad experience, with <a href=#>pornography</a>. I wasn’t going to do that to my characters. I felt I owed it to readers to treat the characters’ intimacy with the same precision and seriousness I would any other intense human experience.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I’ve read too much bad <a href=#>sex</a> in otherwise good books: bizarre, metaphorical sex; coy, breathless sex; baffling, what-just-happened-there sex; most of all, phallocentric, male-experience-dominated sex. Too often, in sex scenes between a man and a woman, the <a href=#>woman’s sensations </a>are barely mentioned, as if her experience is incomprehensible or irrelevant. It’s important to ask why this is — and the fact that a lot of those writers are male is not a satisfactory answer. We don’t put enough value on <a href=#>female pleasure</a> in our culture. The way we write about sex only exacerbates that problem.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In my quest for knowledge and precedent, I sought out scientific research, erotic poetry and literature. I trawled the Internet as much as I could bear. I wanted to dissect the composition of sex scenes — and waded through many, many passages that didn’t come close to answering essential questions: Did she climax? Has this man heard of a clitoris? What were they using for <a href=#>contraception</a>? Some uncovered even more questions about our culture’s perception of female sexuality: Did men in D.H. Lawrence’s time really accuse women of “withholding” their orgasms, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as</a> happens to Lady Chatterley? Because that’s absurd.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There’s so much ignorance, confusion and frustration out there. Delving into sex forums online, I was shocked by the prevalence of questions from women like, “How do I know if I’m having an <a href=#>orgasm</a>?” The fact that so much confusion prevails is no surprise: studies have <a href=# rel=noopener>found</a> that more men orgasm more frequently than women and 40% of women have <a href=# rel=noopener>sexual dysfunction</a>, which can make it difficult to achieve climax. One study <a href=# rel=noopener>found</a> that 80% of women fake orgasms.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The more I read, the more I realized how important it would be for me to write my scenes in steamy, awkward, mutual and real graphic detail. I wanted to write about a sexual relationship in a way that convinced me and reflected what I know to be true about <a href=#>female sexuality</a> — that it’s complicated, beautiful and worth equal attention. So I included accounts of great sex, horrible sex, indifferent sex, sex that just doesn’t work despite both partners’ best intentions — and I showed how and why they were different.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I wanted to create a story that honored the sexual biographies of both partners from both points of view, that showed how they reach the point where they come together and why their relationship is the way it is. And while we’re on the subject of coming together, <a href=#>simultaneous orgasm</a> was one <a href=# rel=noopener>myth</a> I encountered over and over again in my research that was never going to get an outing here.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When my friends began to read my book and wanted to talk about it, I learned things I’d never known about them, and I became more forthright in turn. We tumbled through a flood of questions. Why had we never talked about our <a href=#>sexual pleasure</a> in explicit detail before? Why did we not achieve good, orgasmic sex until our mid-twenties, or later? Why were we too ignorant, too embarrassed to ask? Why did we expect so little in bed?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One reason, we all agreed, was that we’d had to learn about good sex through trial and error, because that behavior wasn’t modeled for us in a <a href=#>healthy</a>, explicit way.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We need to be able to talk, teach, learn, write and read about sex, honestly and seriously, without — or in spite of — derision and censure. Unless we share specifics, we’ll never understand one another’s experiences. You can’t support <a href=#>women’s empowerment</a> without frank and open discussion of their <a href=#>sexuality</a>.<br><i><b></b></i></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Stef</i></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i> Penney </i></a><i>is </i><i>the author of the forthcoming novel </i><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Under a Pole Star</a><i>. </i><i>Her </i><i>first book, </i><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tenderness of Wolves</a><i>, </i><i>won the Costa Prize for Book of the Year, Theakston’s Crime Novel of the Year, and was translated into thirty languages.</i></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>Motto hosts provocative voices and influencers from various spheres.
