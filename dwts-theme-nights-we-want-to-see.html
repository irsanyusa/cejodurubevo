One of the highlights of each season is the themed nights, where the contestants perform dances inspired by a particular theme or genre. While DWTS has covered many themes over the years, there are still plenty of ideas for dream theme nights that we would love to see on the show.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-our-dream-theme-nights-on-dwts>Our Dream Theme Nights on DWTS</h2><p>One dream theme night we would love to see on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> is “Iconic Duets Night.” Many musical legends have performed unforgettable duets throughout the years, from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elton John</a> and Kiki Dee’s “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” to Sonny and Cher’s “I Got You Babe.” Contestants could be paired up and perform iconic duets, bringing a new level of chemistry and performance to the show.</p><p>An additional dream theme night is “Music Video Night.” Music videos have become an integral part of pop culture, and many of them feature elaborate choreography and visuals. Contestants could perform dances inspired by music videos, recreating iconic moments from artists such as Beyoncé, Michael Jackson, and Madonna.</p><p>A fresh and exciting theme night could be “One-Hit Wonder Night.” Contestants could dance to songs from artists who only had one major hit, such as “Whip It” by Devo or “Tainted Love” by Soft Cell. This theme would be a fun and quirky way to mix things up on the show.</p><p>Finally, a “Broadway Night” would be another fantastic theme for the show. Broadway musicals have some of the most memorable and show-stopping song and dance numbers in entertainment history. Contestants could perform dances inspired by hit shows such as Hamilton, Wicked, and Chicago. The judges could even invite Broadway stars as guest judges for an extra special touch.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>DWTS Tour Incorporates New Changes</h2><p>The DWTS tour is undergoing thrilling changes that promise fans an unforgettable and immersive experience that seamlessly merges live performances with the magic of television.
