Until recently, <a href=# rel=noopener>you could watch</a> on Vimeo this DJI Phantom 2 Vision Quadcopter piloted by Viktor Mirzoyan taking off from an area rooftop and shooting stunning footage of the nation’s capital. Then there was the spectacular footage shot by Adam Eidinger, which remains on YouTube for all to see.</p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Too bad it’s illegal—very illegal.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>What’s the problem with flying a remote controlled aircraft in D.C.?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Transportation Security Administration banned nearly all aviation—including model aviation—from what is known at the Flight Restricted Zone (FRZ), a roughly 10-nautical mile area centered around Reagan National Airport in Virginia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/screen-shot-2014-05-05-at-8-47-20-pm.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The FAA’s “Temporary Flight Restriction” (poorly-named in this instance because the one over Washington is permanent) lists the rules for the FRZ in <a href=# rel=noopener>painstaking detail</a>, and apparently with its keyboard stuck on caps-lock:</p><figure class=text-left readability=35.5><p>THE FOLLOWING OPERATIONS ARE NOT AUTHORIZED WITHIN THE DC FRZ: FLIGHT TRAINING, AEROBATIC FLIGHT, PRACTICE INSTRUMENT APPROACHES, GLIDER OPERATIONS, PARACHUTE OPERATIONS, ULTRA LIGHT, HANG GLIDING, BALLOON OPERATIONS, TETHERED BALLOONS, AGRICULTURE/CROP DUSTING, ANIMAL POPULATION CONTROL FLIGHT OPERATIONS, BANNER TOWING OPERATIONS, MAINTENANCE TEST FLIGHTS, MODEL AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS, MODEL ROCKETRY, FLOAT PLANE OPERATIONS, UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) AND AIRCRAFT/HELICOPTERS OPERATING FROM A SHIP OR PRIVATE/CORPORATE YACHT.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>So, what would happen to me?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The FRZ falls within a larger security zone called the Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA), where aircraft are subject to additional security measures but model aircraft flight is permissible. The FRZ and the SFRA may be enforced with deadly force to shoot down an imminent threat, but more often planes are intercepted by fight aircraft and helicopters, escorted to a nearby airport, where the pilots are reamed out by law enforcement, suspended and/or fined.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Knowingly flying a model aircraft or drone in D.C. would violate the rules of the FRZ. —an offense punishable by a fine or up to a year in prison:</p><figure class=text-left readability=28><p><strong>49 U.S. Code § 46307 – Violation of national defense airspace:</strong> A person that knowingly or willfully violates section 40103 (b)(3) of this title or a regulation prescribed or order issued under section 40103 (b)(3) shall be fined under title 18, imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>But will they really catch me?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Doubtful, unless you upload the video to the Internet, crash spectacularly, or get way too close to a really sensitive area like the White House.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>What’s the big deal anyway?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">First off, there’s the safety of people and property on the ground to consider. These devices can weigh well more than 10 pounds, and dropped from even a few stories can do serious damage. Here’s one brilliant pilot’s attempt to fly a drone through midtown Manhattan last year:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The operator was <a href=# rel=noopener>fined</a> $2,200 by the FAA after the remote controlled quadcopter nearly hit a pedestrian.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yosemite National Park in California and Zion National Park in Utah recently announced that flying unmanned aerial vehicles would earn visitors a $5,000 fine, six months in jail, or both because of the danger and disruption they pose.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>And what about privacy?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Good question. Increasingly these mini-aircraft have cameras—some capable of extremely high resolution and transmitting live footage to a laptop or iPhone—and they’re getting cheaper and cheaper. The one used by Mirzoyan retails for about $1000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/51morxspmil-_sl1500_.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>What about if I wanted to fly a drone over the CIA or NSA?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cute idea, but the CIA’s headquarters in Langley, Va. falls within the FRZ. The NSA’s headquarters in Fort Meade, Md. falls within the tightly-controlled Class B airspace for Baltimore Washington International Airport, so you’d be breaking the law.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>So where can I legally fly my remote controlled helicopter or personal drone?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Under long-standing FAA <a href=# rel=noopener>guidelines</a>, model aircraft may be flown below 400 feet above ground level as long as they don’t pose a hazard to people or property on the ground and other aircraft in the sky. When flying within 3 miles of an airport, the airport operator and/or control tower must be notified. But as long as you stay in “Class G” airspace you should be fine.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>So where’s Class G airspace?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s generally airspace below 700 feet or 1,200 feet above ground where air traffic controllers do not provide any services. West of the Rockies it might rise as high as 14,500 feet above sea level in some areas.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Correction: An earlier version of this item stated that CBS used a drone to take photos of the Capitol. It in fact received a permit to use a helicopter.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZxcGdsf3Cw0ailnqtdrK60tMinnq2nnmKxpHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sobriete-fonciere-et-developpement-local-une-equation-difficile-mais-pas-impossible.html><span>←</span><span>une quation difficile, mais pas impossible</span></a>
