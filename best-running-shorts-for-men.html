They have longer legs (so I avoid the skin-on-skin action), but they also have nice slits up the sides so my stride isn’t impacted by the longer legs. They also have a back zip pocket which is handy for keys or a phone. Basically, in the summer months, I like any of their moisture-wicking AEROREADY material.”</p><ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> $45 (sale price $32 at time of publication)</li><li><strong>Inseam:</strong> 5 inches, 7 inches</li><li><strong>Pockets:</strong> 1</li><li><strong>Size range:</strong> XS-2XL</li><li><strong>Material:</strong> Recycled polyester</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Made with 100% recycled materials</li><li>360-degree reflectivity</li><li>Lightweight</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Only come in black</li></ul><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/0b017982aa8fe09facb95924f9be4c6b/4cbce/adidas-x-city-cooler-running-shorts.webp alt="Adidas X-City Cooler Running Shorts" title="Adidas X-City Cooler Running Shorts" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Adidas X-City Cooler Running Shorts</h3></p><h3>The best lightweight running shorts for men: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Nike AeroSwift</a></h3><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/0b017982aa8fe09facb95924f9be4c6b/4cbce/adidas-x-city-cooler-running-shorts.webp></span></a><p>Super lightweight and breathable, these barely-there shorts include deep slits up the sides and a flyvent waistband, ensuring full ventilation throughout your run.

If it’s putting you in the mood to go a little greener, consider shorts from Tasc, who is on track to have all of its products made with at least 85% sustainable materials (recycled and/or plant-based) by 2024. All of their packaging is biodegradable, their sewing facility uses 100% wind and solar energy, and all of the water used in dyeing their clothes gets recovered and reused (minus the small fraction that evaporated, for obvious reasons). All of this, and their Recess shorts are lightweight, stretchy, and breathable.

The time of year often dictates what type of fabric I’m buying as well—as a Canadian, I push the boundaries of when shorts are truly appropriate, outdoor temperature-wise. In the fall and early spring, I’m looking for heavier material with a ‘bike shorts’-type compression liner, but in the summer, I want the lightest material and a mesh lining.”</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Why do running shorts have liners?</h3><p>“Straight up, I think it’s because most of us don’t own technical fabric undies that wick moisture and provide extra support down there,” says Armstrong. “But, as I said, when I’m pushing the boundaries of running in the fall/winter months, I actually prefer shorts with no liner so I can buy winter undies (or <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Wind Brief</a>) that offer weather protection and some more warmth down there.”</p><h3>What should you wear under running shorts?</h3><p>“It depends on the weather, but unless I’m training for a marathon in the mid-winter, I don’t wear anything under my shorts,” admits Armstrong. “I let the liners do their job.”</p><h3>Why are running shorts so short?</h3><p>“This is an interesting question!” says Armstrong. “Professional runners wear short-shorts to help control their body heat, not hinder their stride length, and reduce chafing. But—and this is a big but—us non-pro runners often get more chafing when we wear short-shorts because, let’s face it, we don’t all have [Eliud] Kipchoge’s lean thighs. Skin-on-skin rubbing can be worse than skin-on-lycra, so, while pros favor shorter shorts, I advise anyone with higher amounts of body fat to look for more protection, and maybe even consider wearing shorts with some compression-type additions.”</p><h3>Is it better to run in tight shorts or loose shorts?</h3><p>“Again, this depends on your body weight,” advises Armstrong. “People with higher body fat and larger bodies have skin that moves more during exercise, and compression gear can limit that movement, possibly preventing some chafing and rubbing. But outside of that, it’s a matter of choice. For example, running legend Des Linden is known for her loose-fitting basketball-type shorts, while Shalane Flanagan won the NYC marathon in the tightest of yoga-style shorts. But I will say to beware of shorts that billow too much or have loose pockets: Getting your thumbs caught in flapping material when you’re busting a gut for the finish line is no fun!”</p><h3>What is the difference between running and training shorts?</h3><p>“The differences between ‘running shorts’ in general is as wide as the difference between training shorts and running shorts,” muses Armstrong. “It feels like the wild west out there—everyone has their idea of what shorts should do and be. That’s why many of us end up hoarding a certain pair of shorts when we find a brand/style that we like. Buy a few pairs quickly, before they change the design!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1loqq7r7XNoGSsoJ%2BnwbR5xaipZqWVo3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amazon-books-bookstore.html><span>←</span><span>Amazon Books: See Inside Amazon's New Bookstore</span></a>
