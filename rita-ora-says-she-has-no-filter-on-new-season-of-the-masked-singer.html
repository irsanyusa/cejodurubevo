The singer told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a> that she was “so excited” to join the American version of the show, adding that “it doesn’t feel like work at all.”</p><p>“I think that for me, I shoot for the stars. If I think it, I’m just going to say it,” Ora said of her approach to guessing which celebrities are under the masks. “I think that’s why I love being on the show. I definitely have no filter and some people may be like,&nbsp;What?&nbsp;But I’m like, ‘Who cares?’ I’m going to go for it and I’m here to try and win.”</p><p>As for her relationship with the other panelists, Ora already knew Ken Jeong from their time on The Masked Singer UK. She’s also met Robin Thicke through their shared experience in the music industry. But she met Jenny McCarthy for the first time.</p><p>“And I’d like to think Jenny and I have such a great kind of connection, the two girls in the panel,” Ora explained, “but because I’m sitting right next to Ken and I’ve already known him, I’m definitely more familiar with Ken.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RITA ORA RECEIVES BACKLASH FOR PROMOTING EXPENSIVE MRI SCAN</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewjt6XHzCzM</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-new-season-premieres-march-6>The New Season Premieres March 6</h2><p>Season 11 of The Masked Singer is almost here, as the show is set to premiere March 6 on FOX.
